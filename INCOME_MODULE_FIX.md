# Income Module Navigation Fix

## Issue
The Income Sources module was not opening when clicking the "Start Module" button. All other modules (Assets, VA Benefits, Health Insurance, etc.) were working correctly, but Income would just flash the screen and stay on the hub page.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Process
1. Added comprehensive debug logging to trace the navigation flow
2. Discovered that `_start_module()` was correctly setting navigation state to "module_active"
3. Found that `income.render()` was being called successfully
4. Terminal output revealed a `TypeError` exception mid-execution
5. Exception was being caught and redirecting back to hub

### The Bug
In `products/cost_planner_v2/modules/income.py`, line 161, the code had corrupted widget definitions from a previous `git checkout`:

```python
# WRONG - trying to use st.number_input() with selectbox parameters
other_monthly = st.number_input(
    "Employment Status",  # Wrong label
    options=["not_employed", ...],  # ❌ number_input doesn't support options!
    format_func=lambda x: {...}[x],  # ❌ number_input doesn't support format_func!
    ...
)
```

**The Problem:** The file had been corrupted (likely from `git checkout`) and contained:
1. Duplicate/malformed widget definitions
2. `st.number_input()` being called with `options=` parameter (which only exists for `st.selectbox()`)
3. This caused a `TypeError: number_input() got an unexpected keyword argument 'options'`

This error was caught by the try/except block in `product.py`, which redirected back to the hub ("modules" step), causing the navigation to appear broken.

Additionally, there was a SECOND bug where widget values weren't being properly accessed before calculations (missing session state variable assignments).

## Solution

### Fix 1: Removed corrupted widget code
Replaced the malformed "Other Income" widget section with the correct simple `st.number_input()`:

```python
# CORRECT - proper st.number_input for Other Income
other_monthly = st.number_input(
    "Monthly Amount",
    min_value=0,
    max_value=50000,
    step=100,
    value=st.session_state.cost_v2_income["other_monthly"],
    help="Family support, trust distributions, VA benefits, other income",
    key="other_monthly"
)
```

### Fix 2: Added session state variable assignments
Added explicit variable assignments to read values from session state before using them in calculations:

```python
# Get values from session state (they're stored there via the key= parameter)
ss_monthly = st.session_state.get("ss_monthly", 0)
pension_monthly = st.session_state.get("pension_monthly", 0)
employment_status = st.session_state.get("employment_status", "not_employed")
employment_monthly = st.session_state.get("employment_monthly", 0)
other_monthly = st.session_state.get("other_monthly", 0)

# Calculate total
total_monthly_income = (
    ss_monthly + pension_monthly + employment_monthly + other_monthly
)
```

Now the variables are properly defined before being used in calculations and summary displays.

## Why Other Modules Worked
Other modules (Assets, VA Benefits, Health Insurance, etc.) likely:
1. Didn't try to reference widget values outside of button callbacks, OR
2. Used session state references directly (e.g., `st.session_state.va_benefit_amount`), OR
3. Had different code structure that avoided this issue

## Files Modified
- `products/cost_planner_v2/modules/income.py` (lines 217-224)
  - Added session state variable assignments before calculations

## Additional Fixes
Also applied the module state initialization fix from earlier:
- `products/cost_planner_v2/hub.py` (lines 119-132)
  - Changed initialization to preserve existing module state through reruns

## Testing
1. Navigate to Cost Planner v2 Financial Assessment
2. Click "Start Module" on Income Sources
3. ✅ Module should now open successfully
4. Enter income values in all four cards
5. Verify total calculation displays correctly
6. Test "Save & Continue" returns to hub with "completed" status
7. Test "Edit Module" allows re-entry

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Income module now opens and functions correctly alongside all other modules.
