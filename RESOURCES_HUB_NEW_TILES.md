### 2. Resources Hub Updated (`hubs/resources.py`)

**Changes:**
- Updated `hub_order["ordered_products"]` to include `"med_manage"` and `"predictive_health"`
- Updated `hub_order["total"]` from 5 to 7
- Added product name mappings in both save message handlers
- Created `_build_med_manage_tile()` function
- Created `_build_predictive_health_tile()` function
- Added both tiles to the `cards` list

**Tile Configuration:**
Both tiles use:
- **Variant**: `"teal"` (consistent with other Resources Hub tiles)
- **Visibility**: `visible=True`
- **Locked**: `locked=False`
- **Progress**: `progress=0` (initial state)
- **Primary Button**: "Start"

### 3. Navigation Configuration (`config/nav.json`)

Added two new product entries:
```json
{
  "key": "med_manage",
  "label": "Medication Management",
  "module": "products.med_manage:render",
  "hidden": true
},
{
  "key": "predictive_health",
  "label": "Predictive Health Analytics",
  "module": "products.predictive_health:render",
  "hidden": true
}
```

Both products are `hidden: true` (accessed only via Resources Hub, not in main navigation).

### 4. Image Assets

**New Images Added:**
- `static/images/med_manage.png` (68KB)
- `static/images/predictive_health.png` (59KB)

Both images follow the same format and style as existing Resources Hub product images.
