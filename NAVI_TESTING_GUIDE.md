**Implementation Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Core Complete — Ready for E2E Testing  
**Next Step:** Test flow + Add Trivia integration

---

## 🚀 What's Been Implemented

### ✅ COMPLETE: Advisor Prep → Waiting Room Progression

**Core Infrastructure:**
1. **MCIP Contract Extensions** (`core/mcip.py`)
   - Added `waiting_room` tracking: `advisor_prep_status`, `trivia_status`, `current_focus`
   - Created getters: `get_waiting_room_state()`
   - Created setters: `update_advisor_prep_status()`, `update_trivia_status()`, `set_waiting_room_focus()`
   - Auto-progression: Prep complete → focus shifts to Trivia → Trivia complete → focus shifts to Learning

2. **Concierge Hub Post-PFMA** (`core/navi.py` + `config/navi_dialogue.json`)
   - Detects PFMA completion
   - Shows: "🎉 Congratulations! You've completed your Concierge journey."
   - CTA: "Go to Waiting Room"
   - Context chips show: Care recommendation, Cost estimate, Appointment scheduled

3. **Waiting Room Hub Guidance** (`core/navi.py`)
   - **6 guidance states** mapped to user progress:
     - Prep not started → "Start Prep"
     - Prep in progress → "Continue Prep"
     - Prep complete → "Play Trivia"
     - Trivia in progress → "Resume Trivia"
     - Trivia complete → "Explore Learning Center"
   - Welcome message: "🪑 Welcome to your Waiting Room!"
   - Context chips: Appointment date/time, Prep progress (sections/4), Trivia badges (quizzes/5)

4. **Advisor Prep Status Hooks** (All 4 modules)
   - `personal.py` - Calls `MCIP.update_advisor_prep_status()` on save
   - `financial.py` - Calls `MCIP.update_advisor_prep_status()` on save
   - `housing.py` - Calls `MCIP.update_advisor_prep_status()` on save
   - `medical.py` - Calls `MCIP.update_advisor_prep_status()` on save
   - Status transitions: 0 sections → not_started, 1-3 sections → in_progress, 4 sections → complete

## 🔧 Technical Details

### MCIP Contract Structure

```python
"waiting_room": {
    "advisor_prep_status": "not_started" | "in_progress" | "complete",
    "trivia_status": "not_started" | "in_progress" | "complete",
    "current_focus": "advisor_prep" | "trivia" | "learning"
}
```

**Persistence:** Saved to `mcip_contracts` session key, restored on app load

### Navi Hub Detection Logic

```python
if hub_key == "professional":
    # Professional hub logic
elif hub_key == "waiting_room":
    # Waiting Room progression logic (NEW)
else:
    # Concierge hub logic (UPDATED for post-PFMA)
```

### Status Update Trigger Points

**Advisor Prep:**
- Triggered: In each module's `_save_*_section()` function
- Logic: Counts `sections_complete` length → sets status
- Placement: After MCIP appointment update, before success message

**Trivia (TODO):**
- Trigger: In trivia game completion handler
- Logic: Counts `badges_earned` length → sets status
- Placement: After badge/score saved, before return to hub

**All modified files pass Python compilation checks.**

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Trivia integration incomplete** - Status updates not yet wired (requires finding trivia completion handler)
2. **No backward progression** - If user de-selects prep sections, status doesn't revert (by design - once in_progress, stays in_progress)
3. **No manual status reset** - No UI to manually reset waiting_room status (admin/debug feature could be added later)
