# GCP Confidence Score Calculation

**File:** `products/gcp_v4/modules/care_recommendation/logic.py`  
**Function:** `_calculate_confidence()` (Lines 246-283)

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The confidence score indicates how reliable the care recommendation is based on:
1. **Completeness** - How many required questions were answered
2. **Score Clarity** - How far the total score is from tier boundaries

---

## 📊 Calculation Formula

### Step 1: Calculate Completeness (60% weight)

```python
completeness = required_answered / required_total
```

**Example:**
- User answers 8 out of 10 required questions
- Completeness = 8/10 = 0.8 (80%)

**Note:** Optional questions don't affect completeness

---

### Step 2: Calculate Boundary Confidence (40% weight)

**Tier Thresholds:**
```python
TIER_THRESHOLDS = {
    "independent": (0, 8),      # 0-8 points
    "in_home": (9, 16),          # 9-16 points
    "assisted_living": (17, 24), # 17-24 points
    "memory_care": (25, 100),    # 25+ points
}
```

**Distance from Boundaries:**
```python
# Determine current tier from total score
tier = _determine_tier(total_score)
min_score, max_score = TIER_THRESHOLDS[tier]

# Calculate distance from nearest boundary
distance_from_min = total_score - min_score
distance_from_max = max_score - total_score
distance_from_boundary = min(distance_from_min, distance_from_max)

# Normalize: 3+ points from boundary = 100% boundary confidence
boundary_confidence = min(distance_from_boundary / 3.0, 1.0)
```

**Example 1: Score = 12 (In-Home tier)**
- Tier boundaries: 9-16
- Distance from min (9): 12 - 9 = 3 points
- Distance from max (16): 16 - 12 = 4 points
- Distance from boundary: min(3, 4) = 3 points
- Boundary confidence: 3/3 = 1.0 (100%)

**Example 2: Score = 10 (In-Home tier)**
- Tier boundaries: 9-16
- Distance from min (9): 10 - 9 = 1 point
- Distance from max (16): 16 - 10 = 6 points
- Distance from boundary: min(1, 6) = 1 point
- Boundary confidence: 1/3 = 0.33 (33%)

**Why This Matters:**
- Score near a boundary = less confident (might be wrong tier)
- Score in middle of range = more confident (clearly in this tier)

---

### Step 3: Weighted Average

```python
confidence = (completeness * 0.6) + (boundary_confidence * 0.4)
```

**Weights:**
- **60%** from completeness (more important)
- **40%** from boundary distance

---

### Step 4: Apply Minimum Threshold

```python
return max(0.5, confidence)  # Minimum 50% confidence
```

**Note:** We never show confidence below 50%

---

## 📈 Example Calculations

### Example 1: High Confidence

**Scenario:**
- Answered: 10/10 required questions
- Total score: 20 points → Assisted Living (17-24)
- Distance from boundaries: min(20-17, 24-20) = 3 points

**Calculation:**
```
Completeness = 10/10 = 1.0 (100%)
Boundary confidence = 3/3 = 1.0 (100%)
Confidence = (1.0 × 0.6) + (1.0 × 0.4) = 0.6 + 0.4 = 1.0
Final = max(0.5, 1.0) = 1.0 (100%)
```

**Result:** ✅ 100% confidence

---

### Example 2: Medium Confidence (Near Boundary)

**Scenario:**
- Answered: 8/10 required questions
- Total score: 9 points → In-Home (9-16)
- Distance from boundaries: min(9-9, 16-9) = 0 points

**Calculation:**
```
Completeness = 8/10 = 0.8 (80%)
Boundary confidence = 0/3 = 0.0 (0%)
Confidence = (0.8 × 0.6) + (0.0 × 0.4) = 0.48 + 0 = 0.48
Final = max(0.5, 0.48) = 0.5 (50%)
```

**Result:** ⚠️ 50% confidence (at minimum threshold)

**Why Low:** Score of 9 is exactly on the boundary between Independent (0-8) and In-Home (9-16)

---

### Example 3: Medium-High Confidence

**Scenario:**
- Answered: 9/10 required questions
- Total score: 13 points → In-Home (9-16)
- Distance from boundaries: min(13-9, 16-13) = 3 points

**Calculation:**
```
Completeness = 9/10 = 0.9 (90%)
Boundary confidence = 3/3 = 1.0 (100%)
Confidence = (0.9 × 0.6) + (1.0 × 0.4) = 0.54 + 0.4 = 0.94
Final = max(0.5, 0.94) = 0.94 (94%)
```

**Result:** ✅ 94% confidence

---

### Example 4: Low Confidence (Missing Answers)

**Scenario:**
- Answered: 5/10 required questions
- Total score: 18 points → Assisted Living (17-24)
- Distance from boundaries: min(18-17, 24-18) = 1 point

**Calculation:**
```
Completeness = 5/10 = 0.5 (50%)
Boundary confidence = 1/3 = 0.33 (33%)
Confidence = (0.5 × 0.6) + (0.33 × 0.4) = 0.3 + 0.132 = 0.432
Final = max(0.5, 0.432) = 0.5 (50%)
```

**Result:** ⚠️ 50% confidence (at minimum threshold)

**Why Low:** Only answered half the questions

---

## 🎯 Confidence Score Interpretation

| Score | Display | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 90-100% | High | All questions answered, score clearly in tier range |
| 75-89% | Good | Most questions answered, reasonably clear tier |
| 60-74% | Moderate | Some questions missed or near boundary |
| 50-59% | Low | Many questions missed or right on boundary |
| Below 50% | N/A | Rounded up to 50% minimum |

---

## 🔍 Factors That Reduce Confidence

### 1. Missing Required Questions
- Each unanswered required question reduces completeness
- **Impact:** -10% confidence per missed question (in 10-question set)

### 2. Score Near Tier Boundaries
- Being within 3 points of a boundary reduces boundary confidence
- **Impact:** Up to -40% confidence for scores right on boundaries

### 3. Combination of Both
- Missing questions + near boundary = lowest confidence (50%)

## 🧪 Edge Cases

### Case 1: No Questions Answered
```python
completeness = 0/10 = 0.0
# Would result in very low confidence, but minimum 50% applied
confidence = max(0.5, calculated_value) = 0.5 (50%)
```

### Case 2: All Questions Answered, Score on Boundary
```python
completeness = 10/10 = 1.0 (100%)
boundary_confidence = 0/3 = 0.0 (0%)
confidence = (1.0 × 0.6) + (0.0 × 0.4) = 0.6 (60%)
```
**Still good confidence due to completeness**

### Case 3: Perfect Scenario
```python
completeness = 10/10 = 1.0 (100%)
boundary_confidence = 5/3 = 1.0 (capped at 100%)
confidence = (1.0 × 0.6) + (1.0 × 0.4) = 1.0 (100%)
```
