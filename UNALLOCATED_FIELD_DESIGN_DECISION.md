**Status:** ✅ APPROVED  
**Rating:** 10/10

## Executive Summary

The "Unallocated = Zero in Calculations" approach solves the aggregate distribution problem elegantly by making the Unallocated field purely informational. This eliminates phantom money bugs while giving users complete flexibility to resolve discrepancies on their own terms.

---

## Problem Statement

When implementing Basic/Advanced modes, we need to handle this scenario:

1. **Basic Mode:** User enters $100,000 as total liquid assets
2. System distributes evenly: $50k checking, $50k savings
3. **Advanced Mode:** User switches and corrects values: $30k checking, $40k savings
4. **Problem:** What happens to the $30k discrepancy ($100k estimate vs $70k actual)?

### Previous Attempts Failed Because:
- ❌ Including Unallocated in calculations → Inflated Net Assets (phantom money)
- ❌ Auto-clearing after timeout → Confusing, loses user context
- ❌ Forcing immediate resolution → Bad UX, creates pressure

---

## Solution: "Unallocated = 0 in Calculations"

### Core Principle
**The Unallocated field is displayed for user awareness but NEVER included in financial calculations.**

### How It Works

#### State Structure
```python
{
    # Original Basic mode input (display reference only)
    "liquid_assets_total_entered": 100000,  # NOT used in calculations
    
    # Detail fields (ONLY source of truth)
    "checking_balance": 30000,  # ✅ Used in calculations
    "savings_cds_balance": 40000,  # ✅ Used in calculations
    
    # Calculated on-the-fly (never stored)
    # unallocated = 100000 - (30000 + 40000) = 30000
}
```

#### Calculation Logic
```python
def calculate_total_asset_value(assets_data):
    """
    CRITICAL: Only sum detail fields.
    Never include aggregates, _entered fields, or Unallocated.
    """
    liquid_assets = (
        assets_data.get("checking_balance", 0.0) +
        assets_data.get("savings_cds_balance", 0.0)
    )
    # Unallocated is NOT added here!
    return liquid_assets + ...
```

#### Display Logic
```python
def _render_unallocated_field(field, state):
    original = state.get(f"{aggregate_key}_entered", 0)
    allocated = sum(state.get(field_key, 0) for field_key in detail_fields)
    unallocated = original - allocated
    
    if abs(unallocated) > 0.01:
        st.info(f"""
        📊 Unallocated: ${unallocated:,.2f}
        Your original estimate was ${original:,.2f}.
        You've allocated ${allocated:,.2f} in detail fields.
        
        Note: This amount is NOT included in calculations.
        """)
        
        # Action buttons
        [Clear Original] [Move to "Other"]
```

---

## Why This is Brilliant (10/10)

### ✅ 1. Eliminates Phantom Money
- **Problem:** User guesses $100k, actual is $70k
- **Old approach:** Net Assets = $100k (wrong!)
- **New approach:** Net Assets = $70k (correct!)
- **How:** Calculations ignore `_entered` and Unallocated entirely

### ✅ 2. No Urgency to Resolve
User has three options with no pressure:
1. **Ignore it** → Calculations already correct
2. **Clear original** → Makes Unallocated disappear
3. **Move to "Other"** → Adds to catch-all field

### ✅ 3. Handles Over and Under Estimates

**Over-Estimate:**
```
Original: $100,000
Actual: $70,000
Unallocated: +$30,000 (informational)
Net Assets: $70,000 ✅
```

**Under-Estimate:**
```
Original: $50,000
Actual: $80,000
Unallocated: -$30,000 (warning shown)
Net Assets: $80,000 ✅
```

### ✅ 4. Transparent Feedback
User sees exactly what's happening:
- Original estimate vs actual allocation
- Clear explanation that Unallocated ≠ used in calculations
- Optional actions with clear outcomes

### ✅ 5. User Control
Two clear actions:
- **"Clear Original"** → Removes original estimate, Unallocated disappears
- **"Move to 'Other'"** → Adds Unallocated to "Other Assets" field

## User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Over-Estimate (Most Common)
**Setup:**
1. Basic mode: Enter $100,000 total
2. System distributes: $50k checking, $50k savings
3. Advanced mode: User corrects to $30k checking, $40k savings

**Result:**
- Unallocated: **+$30,000** (shown with info message)
- Net Assets: **$70,000** (uses detail fields only)
- User can ignore (no consequences) ✅

**Actions:**
- Click "Clear Original" → Unallocated disappears
- Click "Move to 'Other'" → Adds $30k to "Other Liquid Assets"
- Do nothing → Calculations still correct

---

### Scenario 2: Under-Estimate
**Setup:**
1. Basic mode: Enter $50,000 total
2. System distributes: $25k checking, $25k savings
3. Advanced mode: User finds more money, enters $40k checking, $40k savings

**Result:**
- Unallocated: **-$30,000** (shown with warning)
- Net Assets: **$80,000** (uses detail fields only)
- Warning: "Your details exceed original estimate. This is fine—details are what matter."

**Actions:**
- Click "Clear Original" → Warning disappears
- Calculations already correct ✅

---

### Scenario 3: Exact Match
**Setup:**
1. Basic mode: Enter $50,000 total
2. System distributes: $25k checking, $25k savings
3. Advanced mode: User adjusts to $30k checking, $20k savings

**Result:**
- Unallocated: **$0.00** (not shown)
- Net Assets: **$50,000**
- No action needed ✅

---

### Scenario 4: User Ignores Unallocated Forever
**Setup:**
1. Basic mode: Enter $100,000 total
2. Advanced mode: Correct to $70,000 actual
3. User never clicks any buttons

**Result:**
- Unallocated: **+$30,000** (shown indefinitely)
- Net Assets: **$70,000** (correct!)
- MCIP: Only contains $70k in detail fields
- Report: Shows $70k Net Assets
- **No bugs, no phantom money!** ✅

## Code Snippets

### Calculation (CRITICAL)
```python
def calculate_total_asset_value(assets_data):
    """
    Only sum detail fields.
    DO NOT include:
    - Aggregate fields (liquid_assets_total)
    - Original estimates (_entered suffix)
    - Unallocated field
    """
    liquid = (
        assets_data.get("checking_balance", 0) +
        assets_data.get("savings_cds_balance", 0)
    )
    investments = (
        assets_data.get("brokerage_mf_etf", 0) +
        assets_data.get("brokerage_stocks_bonds", 0)
    )
    retirement = (
        assets_data.get("traditional_ira", 0) +
        assets_data.get("roth_ira", 0) +
        assets_data.get("401k_403b", 0)
    )
    return liquid + investments + retirement
```

### Display
```python
def _render_unallocated_field(field, state):
    aggregate_key = field["key"]
    detail_fields = field.get("aggregate_from", [])
    
    original_key = f"{aggregate_key}_entered"
    if original_key not in state:
        return  # No original estimate
    
    original = state[original_key]
    allocated = sum(state.get(k, 0) for k in detail_fields)
    unallocated = original - allocated
    
    if abs(unallocated) < 0.01:
        return  # Essentially zero
    
    st.markdown(f"""

### User Experience
- ✅ **No pressure:** User can ignore Unallocated forever
- ✅ **Clear options:** Two explicit actions with clear outcomes
- ✅ **Transparent:** User sees exactly where discrepancy comes from
- ✅ **Forgiving:** Works for over and under estimates

### Code Quality
- ✅ **Simple:** Minimal logic, easy to understand
- ✅ **Maintainable:** Clear separation of display vs calculation
- ✅ **Testable:** Easy to verify correct behavior
- ✅ **Safe:** Can't accidentally break Net Assets calculation

## Lessons Learned

### What We Tried (and Why It Failed)
1. **Including Unallocated in calculations**
   - Result: Phantom money, inflated Net Assets
   - Problem: User can't trust the numbers

2. **Auto-clearing after timeout**
   - Result: Confusing, loses user context
   - Problem: User doesn't understand why it disappeared

3. **Forcing immediate resolution**
   - Result: Bad UX, creates pressure
   - Problem: User might not know the answer right now

### What We Learned
- **Informational fields should never affect calculations**
- **Give users control over when to resolve discrepancies**
- **Calculations should always use the same data (detail fields only)**
- **Transparency builds trust (show the discrepancy, explain it)**

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Document design decision (this file)
2. ✅ Update implementation plan
3. ⏳ Implement Phase 1 prototype
4. ⏳ Test with real user scenarios
5. ⏳ Deploy to production
