# Streamlit Error Styling Fix

## Problem
Streamlit applications can sometimes throw background exceptions that inject error styling into the UI:
- Red borders around text boxes and input fields
- Red backgrounds on buttons
- Red error banners and messages

This creates a poor user experience and makes the application appear broken, even when it's functioning correctly.

## Solution
This repository implements a three-layer defense against Streamlit's error styling:

### 1. Streamlit Configuration (`.streamlit/config.toml`)
```toml
[client]
showErrorDetails = false
```
This disables Streamlit's verbose error details that can trigger red styling on widgets.

**CRITICAL**: Do not remove this setting. It must persist across all deployments.

### 2. CSS Overrides (`assets/css/theme.css`)
The theme CSS includes specific rules to suppress error styling:
```css
/* Suppress Streamlit error styling to prevent red borders and backgrounds */
.stTextInput > div > div > input[aria-invalid="true"],
.stTextArea > div > div > textarea[aria-invalid="true"],
.stSelectbox > div > div[aria-invalid="true"],
.stMultiSelect > div > div[aria-invalid="true"],
.stNumberInput > div > div > input[aria-invalid="true"] {
    border-color: var(--muted) !important;
    background-color: var(--card) !important;
}

.stButton > button[aria-invalid="true"],
.stButton > button[data-testid="baseButton-primary"][aria-invalid="true"] {
    background-color: var(--brand) !important;
    border-color: var(--brand) !important;
    color: #fff !important;
}

.stException,
.stAlert[data-baseweb="notification"][kind="error"] {
    display: none !important;
}
```

These rules:
- Override the red border color on invalid inputs
- Force buttons to maintain brand colors even with error states
- Hide exception and error alert components

**CRITICAL**: Do not remove these CSS rules. They are essential for consistent theming.

### 3. Safe CSS Injection (`app.py`)
```python
def inject_css():
    try:
        with open("assets/css/theme.css", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            st.markdown(f"<style>{f.read()}</style>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        # no-op on Cloud if path differs; don't crash
        pass
```

The try-except block ensures:
- The app doesn't crash if the CSS file is missing (e.g., different paths in cloud deployments)
- Custom theming is applied when available
- Graceful degradation if CSS loading fails

**CRITICAL**: Do not remove the try-except block. It's required for cloud deployment compatibility.

## Deployment Checklist
Before deploying to production or pushing changes, verify:
- [ ] `.streamlit/config.toml` contains `showErrorDetails = false`
- [ ] `assets/css/theme.css` contains error styling suppression rules
- [ ] `app.py` has the CSS injection function with try-except block
- [ ] All three files are committed and pushed to the repository

## Testing
To verify the fix is working:
1. Run the app locally: `streamlit run app.py`
2. Navigate through different pages
3. Check that no red borders or backgrounds appear on widgets
4. Verify the app maintains consistent brand colors throughout

## Maintenance
When making updates to the application:
- Never remove or comment out `showErrorDetails = false` from config.toml
- Preserve the CSS error suppression rules when updating theme.css
- Keep the try-except block when refactoring app.py
- If you add new Streamlit widgets, test them to ensure error styling is suppressed

## Additional Notes
- This solution works with Streamlit >= 1.37
- The CSS rules use `!important` to ensure they override Streamlit's default error styling
- Error suppression is purely cosmetic - actual errors should still be logged and debugged normally
- For production monitoring, consider adding proper error logging that doesn't affect the UI
