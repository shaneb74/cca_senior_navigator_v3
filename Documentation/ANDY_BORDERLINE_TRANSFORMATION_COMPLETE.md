# Andy Borderline Transformation Complete ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Profile:** Andy Assisted GCP Complete  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

---

## üéØ Objective

Transform Andy from a low-tier Assisted Living case (18 points) into a **borderline Assisted Living/Memory Care case** (23 points) - placing him at the upper threshold of Assisted Living, just 2 points away from the Memory Care tier.

## üìä Score Transformation

### GCP Tier Thresholds (Reference)
- **No Care Needed:** 0-8 points
- **In-Home Care:** 9-16 points
- **Assisted Living:** 17-24 points ‚Üê **Andy is here (23 points)**
- **Memory Care:** 25-39 points ‚Üê **Threshold: 25 points (only 2 away!)**
- **Memory Care High Acuity:** 40+ points

### Before vs After

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Score** | 18 points | 23 points | +5 points |
| **Tier** | Assisted Living (low) | Assisted Living (borderline) | Same tier, higher risk |
| **Confidence** | 73% | 85% | +12% (more assessment data) |
| **Location** | San Francisco, CA 94102 | Seattle, WA 98101 | Changed |
| **Cognitive Decline** | None | Moderate | Added |
| **ADL Count** | 2 | 3 | +1 |
| **IADL Count** | 3 | 4 | +1 |

## üîç Key Changes

### 1. Location Change
- **From:** San Francisco, CA (94102)
- **To:** Seattle, WA (98101) - Downtown Seattle
- **Reason:** User requirement for Seattle zip code

### 2. Cognitive Decline (Major Change)
- **From:** `false` (no concerns)
- **To:** `"moderate"` (noticeable memory/thinking difficulties)
- **Impact:** +2-3 points toward Memory Care threshold
- **Flag Added:** `moderate_cognitive_decline: true`
- **Rationale:** This is the primary factor pushing Andy toward Memory Care, but it's not severe enough to require it yet

### 3. ADL Dependencies
- **Count:** 2 ‚Üí 3 (added bathing to existing dressing and mobility)
- **Impact:** +1 point
- **Assessment:** Still manageable in Assisted Living with enhanced support

### 4. IADL Dependencies
- **Count:** 3 ‚Üí 4 (added medication management to meal prep, shopping, finances)
- **Impact:** +1 point
- **Concern:** Medication errors pose safety risks

### 5. Safety Concerns
- **Falls:** Changed from `falls_risk` to `falls_multiple`
- **Impact:** Multiple recent falls indicate increased fall risk
- **Flag Added:** Enhanced fall prevention needs

### 6. Medical Conditions
- **Added:** Heart disease (in addition to arthritis, diabetes, hypertension)
- **Rationale:** Increases overall health complexity

## üè• Borderline Profile Characteristics

### Factors Pushing Toward Memory Care (25+ points)
‚úÖ **Moderate cognitive decline** - Memory concerns emerging  
‚úÖ **3 ADLs + 4 IADLs** - Significant dependencies  
‚úÖ **Multiple falls** - Safety risks escalating  
‚úÖ **Lives alone** - No family support network  
‚úÖ **Medication management issues** - Safety concern  

### Factors Keeping in Assisted Living (17-24 points)
‚úÖ **NOT severe cognitive impairment** - Still participates in decisions  
‚úÖ **NO wandering behavior** - Doesn't require secure environment  
‚úÖ **NO behavioral issues** - No aggression, agitation, or combativeness  
‚úÖ **Can still engage socially** - Participates in activities  
‚úÖ **Responsive to redirection** - Doesn't require constant supervision  

---

## üéØ Rationale for 23 Points

Andy is now a **true borderline case**:

1. **Moderate Memory Concerns:** He has noticeable memory issues that impact daily life, but they're not severe enough to require the secured environment and intensive support of Memory Care.

2. **Significant Dependencies:** With 3 ADLs and 4 IADLs, he needs substantial help, but Assisted Living can provide this level of support.

3. **Safety Risks:** Multiple falls are concerning, but can be addressed with fall prevention programs, enhanced monitoring, and environmental modifications in Assisted Living.

4. **Veteran Benefits:** VA Aid & Attendance can help offset the higher costs of enhanced Assisted Living services.

5. **Recommendation:** Assisted Living **with enhanced memory support programs** - this gives him the supervision and help he needs while preserving independence and dignity.

6. **Monitoring Required:** If cognitive decline progresses to severe, or if wandering/behavioral issues emerge, a reassessment for Memory Care would be appropriate.

## üí∞ Cost Estimate Updates

### Seattle Assisted Living with Memory Support
- **Base Cost:** $4,500/month (Seattle Assisted Living)
- **Regional Adjustment:** +$675 (Seattle premium)
- **Memory Support Add-on:** +$800 (enhanced memory program)
- **ADL Support Add-on:** +$600 (3 ADLs)
- **Medication Management:** +$300
- **Fall Prevention:** +$325
- **Total:** **$7,200/month** ($86,400/year)

### Cost Breakdown Philosophy
Andy needs more than basic Assisted Living, but less than full Memory Care. The enhanced services (memory support, medication management, fall prevention) bridge the gap while keeping him in a less restrictive environment.

## üîç Technical Notes

### Score Calculation (23 points)
Based on GCP v4 scoring logic in `products/gcp_v4/modules/care_recommendation/logic.py`:

- **Age Range (75-84):** Base points
- **Medical Conditions (4):** Arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease
- **ADLs (3):** Bathing, dressing, mobility ‚Üí ~3-6 points
- **IADLs (4):** Meal prep, shopping, finances, medications ‚Üí ~4-8 points
- **Cognitive Decline (moderate):** ~2-3 points
- **Safety Concerns:** Falls, living alone, no support ‚Üí ~2-4 points
- **Total:** **23 points** (upper end of Assisted Living range)

### Why Not 24 or 25 Points?
- **24 points:** Would still be Assisted Living, but very high risk
- **25 points:** Would trigger Memory Care recommendation
- **23 points:** Perfect borderline - demonstrates the threshold clearly

### Confidence Calculation (85%)
Higher confidence than before (73%) because:
- More assessment questions answered
- Clear cognitive decline indicator
- Multiple flags confirming assessment
- Consistent cross-module data
