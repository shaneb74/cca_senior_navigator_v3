# Demo Profile System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a protected demo profile system with automatic UID change detection and data reload. All three demo profiles (John, Sarah, Mary) are working correctly with complete tiles showing on first load.

## Key Features

### 1. Protected Demo Directory System
- **Source Location:** `data/users/demo/` (read-only, never modified)
- **Working Copies:** `data/users/` (created on login, user-modifiable)
- **Behavior:** Fresh copy created on every login ensures clean data

### 2. UID Change Detection (app.py)
**Location:** Lines 146-165

Detects when user switches between accounts (anonymous → demo user) and forces reload:
```python
last_loaded_uid = st.session_state.get("_last_loaded_uid")
needs_reload = "persistence_loaded" not in st.session_state or last_loaded_uid != uid
if needs_reload:
    user_data = load_user(uid)
    merge_into_state(st.session_state, user_data)
    st.session_state["_last_loaded_uid"] = uid
```

**Why This Matters:** 
- Concierge Hub renders before login with anonymous user (empty data)
- UID change from `anon` → `demo_john_cost_planner` triggers reload
- Tiles show complete immediately, no need to navigate away/back

### 3. MCIP Dataclass Field Filtering (core/mcip.py)
**Why:** Demo profiles contain extra fields for debugging/display (assessment_data, scores, monthly_income) that aren't part of MCIP dataclass definitions.

**Solution:**
```python
from dataclasses import fields  # Line 7
valid_fields = {f.name for f in fields(CareRecommendation)}
filtered_data = {k: v for k, v in rec_data.items() if k in valid_fields}
```

**Result:** Demo profiles can have extra fields without breaking dataclass construction.

## Files Modified

### Core System Files
1. **app.py** (lines 146-165)
   - Added UID change detection
   - Forces reload when switching between users

2. **core/session_store.py** (lines 408-425)
   - Always refresh demo working copy from source
   - Uses `shutil.copy2()` to preserve metadata

3. **core/mcip.py**
   - Line 7: Added `fields` to dataclasses import
   - Lines 195-205: Filter CareRecommendation fields
   - Lines 260-270: Filter FinancialProfile fields

4. **hubs/concierge.py** (lines 25-43)
   - Clean render() function (debug logging removed)

### Demo Creation Scripts
1. **create_demo_john_v2.py**
   - Creates Assisted Living profile with proper MCIP fields

2. **create_demo_sarah.py**
   - Creates Memory Care profile
   - Updated to use MCIP field names (estimated_monthly_cost vs monthly_income)

3. **create_demo_mary.py**
   - Creates Memory Care High Acuity profile
   - Complex medical history and conditions

4. **pages/login.py** (lines 11-24)
   - Updated DEMO_USERS dict with correct UIDs and descriptions

## Testing Results

✅ **All 3 demo profiles verified working:**
- Login → Click demo button → Tiles show complete immediately
- Can view GCP recommendations (care tier, score, flags)
- Can view Cost Planner timelines (years, monthly gap, runway)
- Can switch between users without issues
- No navigation away/back needed

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Timing Issue Fixed
**Problem:** Concierge Hub rendered before user logged in, showing empty tiles
**Solution:** UID change detection forces reload when switching from anonymous to demo user

### 2. Data Overwrite Fixed
**Problem:** Working copy created with empty data before demo copy mechanism ran
**Solution:** Modified `load_user()` to always refresh from demo source (removed `if not path.exists()` check)

### 3. Field Mismatch Fixed
**Problem:** TypeError when constructing dataclasses due to extra fields in demo profiles
**Solution:** Filter dict to only valid dataclass fields before construction

### 4. Import Error Fixed
**Problem:** `from dataclasses import fields` inside method caused errors
**Solution:** Move import to module level (line 7 of mcip.py)

## Architecture Benefits

### Separation of Concerns
- **Demo Sources:** Protected, version-controlled, never modified by app
- **Working Copies:** Ephemeral, user-modifiable, can be deleted for reset
- **Auto-Refresh:** Always get clean data on login

### Data Integrity
- Demo profiles contain complete, realistic data
- Extra fields for debugging don't break dataclass construction
- Field filtering allows flexibility in demo profile structure

### User Experience
- Immediate feedback (tiles show complete on login)
- No confusing empty state on first render
- Can switch between demo users seamlessly

## Maintenance Notes

### Adding New Demo Profiles
1. Create JSON file in `data/users/demo/`
2. Add entry to `pages/login.py` DEMO_USERS dict
3. Test login and verify tiles show complete

### Updating Demo Data
1. Edit source file in `data/users/demo/`
2. Delete working copy in `data/users/` (if exists)
3. Login to get fresh copy with updates

### Resetting Demo State
```bash
# Delete all working copies
rm data/users/demo_john_cost_planner.json
rm data/users/demo_sarah_cost_planner.json
rm data/users/demo_mary_full_data.json

# Next login will create fresh copies from demo sources
```

## Production Readiness

### Cleanup Completed
- ✅ All debug logging removed
- ✅ Clean, production-ready code
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Graceful degradation if demo files missing

### Logging (Production)
Only shows:
- `[DEMO] Loading fresh demo profile from: ...`
- `[DEMO] Creating/refreshing working copy at: ...`
- `[DEMO] ✅ Demo profile copied successfully!`

### Future Enhancements
1. **Demo Reset Utility:** Script to delete all working copies at once
2. **Documentation:** Update guides to include Sarah and Mary profiles
3. **Condition-Based Demos:** Add demos with specific conditions (diabetes, COPD, etc.)
4. **Partial Progress:** Demos with incomplete assessments to show in-progress states
