# VA Disability Payment Display Label Fix

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Issue:** VA Disability Monthly Payment showing as textbox instead of display label  
**Branch:** `bugfix/gcp-issues`  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## Problem Summary

In the VA Benefits assessment, the "Monthly VA Disability Payment" field was showing as an editable textbox (even with read-only flag), when it should be a **display-only label** showing the auto-calculated amount.

### User Confusion

- Field appeared as input textbox (confusing)
- Users thought they needed to enter it manually
- Even grayed-out, it still looked like an input field
- Should be a clean display label, not an input

### Technical Issue

The field was configured as `"type": "currency"` which renders as `st.number_input()`. Even with `disabled=True`, it still renders as a textbox widget.

**What was needed:** A true display-only label - not an input at all.

---

## The Solution

### New Field Type: `display_currency`

Created a new field type specifically for displaying calculated currency values as formatted labels (not inputs).

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Renders as styled display box (not input widget)
- ✅ Shows formatted currency ($1,622.44)
- ✅ Large, prominent text
- ✅ Clean design (no input affordances)
- ✅ Value from state (auto-calculated)
- ✅ Still contributes to summary calculation

---

## Code Changes

### 1. VA Benefits Config (`va_benefits.json`)

**File:** `products/cost_planner_v2/modules/assessments/va_benefits.json`  
**Line:** ~137

```json
// BEFORE (v1 - Editable):
{
  "key": "va_disability_monthly",
  "label": "Monthly VA Disability Payment",
  "type": "currency",  // ❌ Renders as number_input (editable textbox)
  "required": false,
  "min": 0,
  "max": 10000,
  "step": 10,
  "default": 0,
  "help": "..."
}

// AFTER (v3 - Display Label):
{
  "key": "va_disability_monthly",
  "label": "Monthly VA Disability Payment",
  "type": "display_currency",  // ✅ Renders as display label (not input)
  "required": false,
  "default": 0,
  "help": "This amount is automatically calculated based on your disability rating and dependents using 2025 official VA rates."
}
```

**Changes:**
- Changed type from `"currency"` to `"display_currency"`
- Removed `min`, `max`, `step`, `readonly` (not needed for display)
- Kept `default` for fallback value
- Kept `help` text for user context

### 2. Assessment Engine (`assessment_engine.py`)

**File:** `core/assessment_engine.py`  
**Function:** `_render_fields()` - Added new field type handler

```python
elif field_type == "display_currency":
    # Display-only currency label (no input, just shows formatted value)
    # Value comes from state (e.g., auto-calculated VA disability amount)
    display_value = float(current_value) if current_value is not None else 0.0
    formatted_value = f"${display_value:,.2f}"
    
    # Render as a styled display box
    container.markdown(
        f"""
        <div style="
            background: #f8fafc;
            border: 1px solid #e2e8f0;
            border-radius: 8px;
            padding: 12px 16px;
            font-size: 24px;
            font-weight: 600;
            color: #0f172a;
            text-align: left;
            margin-bottom: 8px;
        ">
            {formatted_value}
        </div>
        """,
        unsafe_allow_html=True,
    )
    
    # Don't include in new_values since it's display-only
    # (value already in state from auto-calculation)
```

**How it works:**
1. Gets current value from state (`current_value`)
2. Formats as currency with commas and 2 decimals (`$1,622.44`)
3. Renders as styled HTML div (not Streamlit widget)
4. Large text (24px), bold, in styled box
5. Doesn't update `new_values` (read-only, value from state)

## Visual Design

### Before Fix (Textbox)
```
Monthly VA Disability Payment
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ 1622.44          [-]  [+]   │ ← Grayed textbox, still looks like input
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### After Fix (Display Label)
```
Monthly VA Disability Payment
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│                              │
│   $1,622.44                  │ ← Clean display label, large text
│                              │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key differences:**
- No input box appearance
- No +/- buttons
- Larger, more prominent text
- Styled background (light gray)
- Clearly a display value, not an input

---

## How It Works

### Data Flow

```
1. User selects rating: "60%"
2. User selects dependents: "Veteran with spouse and one child"
3. _auto_populate_va_disability() calculates: $1,622.44
4. Updates state: state["va_disability_monthly"] = 1622.44
5. safe_rerun() triggers page refresh
6. Field renders:
   - Reads value from state: 1622.44
   - Formats: "$1,622.44"
   - Renders as HTML display box ✅
7. User sees: Large "$1,622.44" in styled box
8. Summary calculation: Reads same value from state
9. Summary shows: "$1,622/month" ✅
10. Both match ✅
```

**Key Point:** The field never appears as an input - it's purely display.

### Auto-Calculation (Unchanged)

The auto-population logic in `assessments.py` is **unchanged**:

```python
# In _render_section_content() - line ~720
if assessment_key == "va_benefits" and section.get("id") == "va_disability":
    has_disability = state.get("has_va_disability") == "yes"
    rating = state.get("va_disability_rating")
    dependents = state.get("va_dependents")
    
    if has_disability and rating is not None and dependents:
        from products.cost_planner_v2.va_rates import get_monthly_va_disability
        
        calculated_amount = get_monthly_va_disability(rating, dependents)
        if calculated_amount is not None:
            state["va_disability_monthly"] = calculated_amount  # ✅ Still works
```

**The only change:** How the value is **displayed** (as label instead of input).

   Expected: Both match (rounded) ✅
   Actual: Both match ✅
```

#### Test 5: Visual Design ✅
```
Expected:
- Large text (24px) ✅
- Bold font ✅

## Comparison: Three Approaches

### Approach 1: Editable Currency Field (Original)
```json
{"type": "currency"}
```
**Pros:** Can manually adjust if needed  
**Cons:** ❌ Confusing (looks like user input needed), ❌ Users might override calculation

### Approach 2: Read-Only Currency Field (v2)
```json
{"type": "currency", "readonly": true}
```
**Pros:** ✅ Prevents editing  
**Cons:** ❌ Still looks like input, ❌ Grayed out but has +/- buttons

### Approach 3: Display Label (v3 - Final) ✅
```json
{"type": "display_currency"}
```
**Pros:** ✅ Clean display, ✅ Clear it's calculated, ✅ Large prominent text, ✅ No input affordances  
**Cons:** None - perfect for display-only calculated values

**Winner:** Approach 3 - Display Label

- ✅ **Crystal clear:** Obviously a calculated/display value
- ✅ **No confusion:** Can't be mistaken for user input
- ✅ **Prominent:** Large text draws attention
- ✅ **Professional:** Clean, polished appearance
- ✅ **Accessible:** High contrast, readable

### Technical
- ✅ **Simple implementation:** Pure HTML, no widget complexity
- ✅ **No state pollution:** Doesn't create new keys
- ✅ **Reusable pattern:** Can use for other calculated fields
- ✅ **No validation needed:** Display-only, can't have invalid input
- ✅ **Lightweight:** No Streamlit widget overhead

### Maintainability

---

## Reusable Pattern

### Other Fields That Could Use `display_currency`

**Cost Planner:**
- Total Monthly Income (sum of all income sources)
- Total Asset Value (sum of all assets)
- Total Monthly Expenses (if calculated)

**GCP:**
- Estimated Monthly Care Cost (from quick estimate)
- Total Budget Available (income - expenses)

### Other Display Types to Add

```python
elif field_type == "display_text":
    # Display-only text label (e.g., calculated recommendation)
    container.markdown(f"<div style='...'>{current_value}</div>", unsafe_allow_html=True)

elif field_type == "display_number":
    # Display-only number (e.g., total count, score)
    formatted = f"{float(current_value):,.0f}"
    container.markdown(f"<div style='...'>{formatted}</div>", unsafe_allow_html=True)

elif field_type == "display_percent":
    # Display-only percentage (e.g., calculated eligibility)
    formatted = f"{float(current_value):.1f}%"
    container.markdown(f"<div style='...'>{formatted}</div>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. No Value Yet (Default 0)
```
State: va_disability_monthly = None or 0
Display: $0.00
Behavior: Shows $0.00 in styled box
✅ Correct - clear placeholder
```

### 2. Very Large Numbers
```
State: va_disability_monthly = 4057.73 (100% + spouse)
Display: $4,057.73
Behavior: Comma formatting makes it readable
✅ Correct
```

### 3. Fractional Cents (Edge Case)
```
State: va_disability_monthly = 1622.444 (rounding error)
Display: $1,622.44
Behavior: Formats to 2 decimals automatically
✅ Correct
```

### 4. Save and Reload
```
Scenario: User saves, then reopens
Behavior:
- Saved value loads from JSON
- Displays in label box
- Still display-only
- If rating changes, recalculates
✅ Correct
```
