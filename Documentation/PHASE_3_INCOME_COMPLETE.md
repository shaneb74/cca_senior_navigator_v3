# Phase 3 Complete: Income Assessment Enhanced

**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Branch:** `feature/basic-advanced-mode-exploration`  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - Ready for Design Improvements

---

## Overview

Phase 3 extends Basic/Advanced mode support to the **Income assessment**:
- **Social Security & Pensions**
- **Employment & Other Income**
- **Additional Income (Advanced)**

Combined with Phase 1-2's Assets assessment (5 sections), we now have **8 sections total** with full mode support across two assessments.

---

## What Changed

### 1. Social Security & Pensions Section
**New Features:**
- ‚úÖ Mode toggle (Basic/Advanced)
- ‚úÖ New aggregate field: `retirement_income_total`
- ‚úÖ Detail fields: `ss_monthly`, `pension_monthly`
- ‚úÖ Unallocated field support with "Clear" and "Move to Pension" actions
- ‚úÖ Even distribution strategy in Basic mode

**Configuration:**
```json
"mode_config": {
  "supports_basic_advanced": true,
  "basic_mode_aggregate": "retirement_income_total",
  "advanced_mode_fields": ["ss_monthly", "pension_monthly"]
}
```

**Basic Mode:**
- User enters total monthly retirement income (e.g., $3,000)
- System splits evenly: $1,500 to SS, $1,500 to pension

**Advanced Mode:**
- User enters SS: $2,100
- User enters pension: $800
- System calculates total: $2,900 (read-only)

---

### 2. Employment & Other Income Section
**New Features:**
- ‚úÖ Mode toggle (Basic/Advanced)
- ‚úÖ New aggregate field: `employment_other_total`
- ‚úÖ Detail fields: `employment_income`, `other_income`
- ‚úÖ `employment_status` field visible in both modes (not aggregated)
- ‚úÖ Unallocated field with "Clear" and "Move to Other" actions
- ‚úÖ Even distribution between two income types

**Configuration:**
```json
"mode_config": {
  "supports_basic_advanced": true,
  "basic_mode_aggregate": "employment_other_total",
  "advanced_mode_fields": ["employment_income", "other_income"]
}
```

**Note:** `employment_status` dropdown remains visible in both modes since it's qualitative, not part of the aggregate.

---

### 3. Additional Income (Advanced) Section
**New Features:**
- ‚úÖ Mode toggle (Basic/Advanced)
- ‚úÖ New aggregate field: `additional_income_total`
- ‚úÖ **7 detail fields** in Advanced mode:
  - Annuity (Monthly)
  - IRA/401(k) Distributions (Monthly)
  - Dividends & Interest (Monthly)
  - Rental Income (Monthly)
  - Alimony/Support (Monthly)
  - LTC Insurance Benefits
  - Family Support (Monthly)
- ‚úÖ Even distribution across all 7 categories in Basic mode
- ‚úÖ Unallocated with "Move to Dividends & Interest" option

**Configuration:**
```json
"mode_config": {
  "supports_basic_advanced": true,
  "basic_mode_aggregate": "additional_income_total",
  "advanced_mode_fields": [
    "annuity_monthly",
    "retirement_distributions_monthly",
    "dividends_interest_monthly",
    "rental_income_monthly",
    "alimony_support_monthly",
    "ltc_insurance_monthly",
    "family_support_monthly"
  ]
}
```

**Basic Mode Example:**
- User enters $7,000 total additional income
- System distributes $1,000 to each of 7 categories

**Advanced Mode Example:**
- User enters annuity: $2,000
- User enters rental income: $3,500
- User enters dividends: $1,200
- System calculates total: $6,700
- Unallocated: $300 (if original was $7,000)

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `products/cost_planner_v2/modules/assessments/income.json`
**Changes:**
- Added `mode_config` to 3 sections
- Created 3 new aggregate_input fields with mode_behavior
- Added `visible_in_modes: ["advanced"]` to 9 detail fields
- **Removed old `level: "basic"` and `level: "advanced"` properties** (replaced with mode system)
- Updated `output_contract` to include 3 new aggregate fields

## Critical Calculation Test

### Scenario: Total Monthly Income Calculation
**Setup:**
- Retirement income: $3,000 Basic ‚Üí $2,900 Advanced (Unallocated: $100)
- Employment: $5,000 Basic ‚Üí $4,200 Advanced (Unallocated: $800)
- Additional: $7,000 Basic ‚Üí $6,700 Advanced (Unallocated: $300)
- Partner contribution: $1,000 (not mode-specific)

**Expected Total Monthly Income:**
```
Total = $2,900 + $4,200 + $6,700 + $1,000 = $14,800
```

**MUST NOT include:**
```
Wrong: $3,000 + $5,000 + $7,000 + $1,000 = $16,000 ‚ùå
```

**PASS if:** Total Monthly Income = $14,800 (uses detail fields only, ignores $1,200 unallocated) ‚úÖ

---

## Known Issues & Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ Working As Designed

1. **Employment Status Always Visible**
   - `employment_status` dropdown appears in both Basic and Advanced modes
   - This is correct - it's qualitative, not part of income aggregate
   - Users can select employment status regardless of mode

2. **Partner Income Not Mode-Specific**
   - `partner_income_monthly` in Household Context section
   - No mode toggle for this section (context, not aggregated data)
   - Remains a single input field

3. **Additional Income Distribution**
   - Basic mode splits $7,000 evenly: $1,000 to each of 7 categories
   - Real users typically only use 2-3 categories
   - Even distribution is a starting point for adjustment in Advanced mode
   - Future: Proportional or smart distribution strategies

4. **Section Naming**
   - "Additional Income (Advanced)" section name is historical
   - This section now has Basic mode too
   - Could be renamed to just "Additional Income" for clarity
   - Leaving as-is for now (not breaking change)

## Design Improvement Notes

Now that we have 8 sections with mode support, several design and hierarchy improvements are needed:

### 1. **Mode Toggle Visual Hierarchy** üé®
**Current:** Mode toggle renders at section level (inline with section title)
**Issue:** May compete with section headers for visual attention
**Improvement Ideas:**
- Sticky mode toggle that follows scroll?
- Compact mode indicator instead of full toggle?
- Global mode preference (all sections in Basic or all in Advanced)?
- Remember mode choice per section per user?

### 2. **Unallocated Field Prominence** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Current:** Unallocated field appears inline with other fields
**Issue:** Users might miss it or not understand its purpose
**Improvement Ideas:**
- Highlight unallocated with colored background (yellow warning?)
- Floating notification when unallocated amount > 10% of total?
- Summary panel showing all unallocated amounts across sections?
- Quick actions: "Resolve All Unallocated" button?

### 3. **Distribution Strategy Selection** üîÄ
**Current:** All sections use "even" distribution
**Issue:** Even distribution doesn't always make sense
**Improvement Ideas:**
- Let users choose distribution in JSON: "even" | "proportional" | "manual"
- Smart distribution based on field semantics (SS typically > pension)
- User-controlled distribution percentages in UI
- Remember last distribution pattern per user

### 4. **Section Help Guidance** üí°
**Current:** Static help text per section
**Issue:** Doesn't explain mode toggle or when to use Basic vs Advanced
**Improvement Ideas:**
- Mode-specific help text (different guidance for Basic vs Advanced)
- First-time tooltips: "New! Use Basic for quick estimates"
- Contextual tips: "Switch to Advanced to break this down further"
- Video tutorial link or inline demo

### 5. **Calculation Summary Visibility** üìä
**Current:** Summary at end of assessment
**Issue:** Users can't see impact of unallocated amounts in real-time
**Improvement Ideas:**
- Live summary panel (sidebar or sticky footer)
- Show NET ASSETS and TOTAL MONTHLY INCOME updating live
- Highlight when unallocated amounts are NOT included
- "What-if" mode: Preview with/without unallocated

### 6. **Accessibility & Mobile** üì±
**Current:** Two-column layout may not be mobile-friendly
**Issue:** Mode toggle + fields might be cramped on small screens
**Improvement Ideas:**
- Responsive layout: single column on mobile
- Larger tap targets for mode toggle buttons
- Swipe gesture to switch modes (mobile)?
- Keyboard shortcuts for mode switching (desktop)

### 7. **Data Persistence & Undo** üíæ
**Current:** Mode switches recalculate immediately
**Issue:** No undo if user accidentally switches modes
**Improvement Ideas:**
- Confirm before switching mode if values entered
- "Restore previous values" option after mode switch
- Undo/redo stack for field changes
- Save draft button (separate from auto-save)

### 8. **Performance & Scalability** ‚ö°
**Current:** 8 sections √ó mode toggles = 8 separate state keys
**Issue:** Session state might get large with many users
**Improvement Ideas:**
- Lazy-load sections (render only visible sections)
- Debounce calculations (wait for user to finish typing)
- Cache calculated values (avoid recalculating on every render)
- Profile performance with 100+ fields

## Next Steps

### Immediate: Design & Hierarchy Review
**Priority Items:**
1. **Visual Hierarchy of Mode Toggle**
   - Should it be prominent or subtle?
   - Current "‚ö° Basic / üìä Advanced" design - keep or improve?
   - Placement: top of section vs floating?

2. **Unallocated Field Visibility**
   - How do we ensure users notice unallocated amounts?
   - Warning threshold: Show alert if unallocated > $X or >Y%?
   - Bulk actions: "Resolve all unallocated across all sections"?

3. **Mode Guidance**
   - When should users use Basic mode?
   - When should they switch to Advanced?
   - Add contextual help or tutorial?

4. **Distribution Strategy**
   - Keep "even" distribution or add options?
   - Smart defaults based on field types?
   - User-configurable distribution?

### Phase 4: Polish & Documentation (After Design Review)
**Tasks:**
- Implement approved design improvements
- Update user guide with mode switching instructions
- Create video demos: Basic vs Advanced workflow
- Add tooltips and contextual help
- Performance testing and optimization
- Accessibility audit (WCAG compliance)
- Mobile testing and responsive fixes

### Phase 5: Production Deployment
**Checklist:**
- [ ] All design improvements implemented
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code review complete
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Merge feature branch to dev
- [ ] Deploy to staging
- [ ] Final QA

1. Mode toggle visual design and placement
2. Unallocated field prominence and warnings
3. Distribution strategy options
4. Mode guidance and tutorials
5. Real-time calculation visibility
6. Mobile responsiveness
7. Accessibility improvements
8. Performance optimization

**Let's discuss design improvements and make decisions before implementing Phase 4 polish.**
