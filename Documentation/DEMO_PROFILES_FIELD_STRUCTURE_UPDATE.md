## 🎯 Objective

Update primary demo user profiles (John Test and Veteran Vic) to align with the **restored asset field structure** (9 detailed fields) implemented in Cost Planner.

---

## 👥 Demo Profile Strategy

### **John Test (demo_john_cost_planner)**
**Purpose:** Demonstrate complete user journey  
**Status:** GCP ✅ Complete | Cost Planner ✅ Complete

**Use Case:**
- Show prefill functionality in Advisor Prep
- Demonstrate Financial Review with complete data
- Test timeline projections with all 9 asset fields
- Reference profile for regression testing

---

### **Veteran Vic (demo_vic_veteran_borderline)**
**Purpose:** Demonstrate fresh user experience  
**Status:** GCP ✅ Complete | Cost Planner ❌ Not Started

**Use Case:**
- Show Cost Planner onboarding from scratch
- Demonstrate borderline care tier (In-Home vs Assisted Living)
- Test VA benefits integration
- New user experience testing

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### **1. John Test Profile (`create_demo_john_v2.py`)**

#### **Assets Data Structure Updated**

**Removed Obsolete Fields:**
```python
# OLD - Aggregate fields (no longer used)
"cash_liquid_total": 5000.0,      # ❌ REMOVED
"brokerage_total": 20000.0,       # ❌ REMOVED
"retirement_total": 0.0,          # ❌ REMOVED
```

**Added Restored Fields:**
```python
# NEW - Detailed breakdown with all 9 restored fields

# Liquid Assets (3 fields) = $5,000
"checking_balance": 2000.0,
"savings_cds_balance": 3000.0,
"cash_on_hand": 0.0,  # ✅ RESTORED FIELD

# Investments (3 fields) = $20,000
"brokerage_stocks_bonds": 5000.0,
"brokerage_mf_etf": 15000.0,
"brokerage_other": 0.0,  # ✅ RESTORED FIELD

# Retirement (3 fields) = $0
"retirement_traditional": 0.0,
"retirement_roth": 0.0,
"retirement_pension_value": 0.0,  # ✅ RESTORED FIELD

# Real Estate (2 fields - Advanced mode) = $175,000
"home_equity_estimate": 175000.0,
"real_estate_other": 0.0,

# Life Insurance (1 field) = $5,000
"life_insurance_cash_value": 5000.0,
```

**Result:**
- Total assets unchanged: **$205,000**
- Now uses all 12 asset fields (9 basic + 2 real estate + 1 life insurance)
- Organized with inline comments for clarity
- Duplicated in both `cost_v2_modules.assets.data` and `tiles.cost_planner_v2.assessments.assets`

---

#### **Header Documentation Updated**

**Before:**
```python
"""
This profile contains:
- Complete Income & Assets assessments  
- Total monthly income: $6,200
- Net assets: $195,000 (liquid: $30k, home: $175k, other: $5k, debt: -$10k)
"""
```

**After:**
```python
"""
This profile contains:
- Complete Income & Assets assessments (using restored field structure)
- Total monthly income: $6,200
- Total assets: $205,000
  - Liquid Assets: $5,000 (checking: $2k, savings: $3k, cash: $0)
  - Investments: $20,000 (stocks/bonds: $5k, funds: $15k, other: $0)
  - Retirement: $0 (traditional: $0, roth: $0, pension: $0)
  - Real Estate: $175,000 (home equity: $175k, other: $0)
  - Life Insurance: $5,000
"""
```

**Improvements:**
- Accurate asset breakdown showing all categories
- Reflects current field structure
- Easier to understand profile composition at a glance

---

### **2. Veteran Vic Profile (`create_demo_vic.py`)**

#### **No Changes Required**

**Status:** GCP complete, Cost Planner **NOT started**

**Why No Changes:**
- Intentionally has no Cost Planner data
- Demonstrates fresh user onboarding experience
- Quick estimate only (no detailed assessments)
- Used for testing new user flow, not prefill logic

**Profile Summary:**
```python
"cost_v2_step": "welcome",  # Not started
"cost_v2_modules": {},      # Empty
"tiles": {
    "gcp_v4": {"status": "done", "progress": 100.0},
    "cost_planner_v2": {"status": "not_started", "progress": 0}
}
```
