# Cost Planner Tile - Three Button Fix

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Branch:** bugfix/new-fix  
**Issue:** Cost Planner tile needed three distinct actions when complete  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem Statement

When the Cost Planner was completed, the tile only had two buttons:
- **Primary**: "Review Assessment" → cost_review page (QA/debugging)
- **Secondary**: "Restart" → went to summary page ❌ (should go to quick estimate)

**User feedback:**
> "The restart button should go back to Quick Estimate, then there should be a 'Review Assessment' (developer/QA view), THEN there should be a 'View My Plan' that goes back to the Financial Assessment page."

**Required buttons when complete:**
1. **"View My Plan"** → Financial Assessment hub (review/modify existing data)
2. **"Review Assessment"** → Cost Review page (QA/debugging view with raw data)
3. **"Restart"** → Quick Estimate intro (start completely fresh)

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Leveraged Existing Tertiary Button Support ✅

The `ProductTile` system already supported tertiary buttons! Properties existed but weren't being used:
- `tertiary_label`
- `tertiary_route`  
- `tertiary_go`
- `_tertiary_href()` method

**File:** `core/product_tile.py` (lines 193-195, 285-297, 324-335)

**No changes needed** - infrastructure was already in place!

---

### 2. Updated Cost Planner Tile Configuration

**File:** `hubs/concierge.py` - `_build_cost_planner_tile()`

**Added three-button configuration when complete:**

```python
if is_complete:
    # 1. Primary: View My Plan (go back to assessments to review/modify)
    button_label = "View My Plan"
    primary_route_override = "?page=cost_v2&step=assessments"
    
    # 2. Secondary: Review Assessment (QA/debugging view)
    secondary_button_label = "👁️ Review Assessment"
    secondary_route_override = "?page=cost_review"
    
    # 3. Tertiary: Restart (go back to quick estimate)
    tertiary_button_label = "↻ Restart"
    tertiary_route_override = "?page=cost_v2&step=intro"
```

**All other states** (in_progress, locked, etc.) set these to `None`:
```python
else:
    # ... other button config ...
    secondary_button_label = None
    secondary_route_override = None
    tertiary_button_label = None
    tertiary_route_override = None
```

---

### 3. Added Step Query Parameter Support

**File:** `products/cost_planner_v2/product.py` - `render()`

**Problem:** Buttons set `?step=assessments` or `?step=intro`, but product ignored query params.

**Solution:** Added query param handling to override `cost_v2_step`:

```python
# Initialize step state
if "cost_v2_step" not in st.session_state:
    # Check query params for explicit step override (from tile buttons)
    step_from_query = st.query_params.get("step")
    if step_from_query in ["intro", "auth", "triage", "assessments", ...]:
        st.session_state.cost_v2_step = step_from_query
    # ... existing logic ...
else:
    # If step already exists, allow query param to override
    step_from_query = st.query_params.get("step")
    if step_from_query in ["intro", "auth", "triage", "assessments", ...]:
        if st.session_state.cost_v2_step != step_from_query:
            st.session_state.cost_v2_step = step_from_query
```

**Why this works:**
- `?page=cost_v2&step=intro` → loads cost_v2 product with step forced to "intro" (quick estimate)
- `?page=cost_v2&step=assessments` → loads cost_v2 product with step forced to "assessments" (financial hub)
- Existing `_handle_restart_if_needed()` only triggers when `cost_v2_step == "intro"` AND product is complete, so it won't interfere with "View My Plan"

## How It Works

### User Journey When Complete:

**Scenario 1: View My Plan** (most common)
```
User clicks "View My Plan"
  ↓
Navigate to: ?page=cost_v2&step=assessments&uid=anon_xxx
  ↓
product.py detects step=assessments from query param
  ↓
Sets: st.session_state.cost_v2_step = "assessments"
  ↓
Renders: _render_assessments_step()
  ↓
User sees: Financial Assessment Hub with all their saved data
```

**Scenario 2: Review Assessment** (QA/debugging)
```
User clicks "👁️ Review Assessment"
  ↓
Navigate to: ?page=cost_review&uid=anon_xxx
  ↓
Renders: Cost Review page with raw JSON data
  ↓
User sees: All assessment responses, calculations, expert review data
```

**Scenario 3: Restart** (start fresh)
```
User clicks "↻ Restart"
  ↓
Navigate to: ?page=cost_v2&step=intro&uid=anon_xxx
  ↓
product.py detects step=intro from query param
  ↓
Sets: st.session_state.cost_v2_step = "intro"
  ↓
_handle_restart_if_needed() detects: complete=true AND step=intro
  ↓
Clears all Cost Planner state (modules, assessments, etc.)
  ↓
Renders: _render_intro_step() (quick estimate form)
  ↓
User sees: Fresh quick estimate form with empty fields
```

## Button Styling

All three buttons use existing CSS classes:

1. **Primary (solid/colored):** `dashboard-cta--primary`
   - "View My Plan" - most common action
   - Brand color background, white text

2. **Secondary (ghost/outline):** `dashboard-cta--ghost`
   - "👁️ Review Assessment" - less common, QA use
   - Transparent background, border, colored text

3. **Tertiary (ghost/outline):** `dashboard-cta--ghost`
   - "↻ Restart" - least common, destructive action
   - Same styling as secondary
   - ↻ icon indicates "reset" action

## Testing Checklist

### Test 1: View My Plan ✅
```
1. Complete Cost Planner (all assessments done)
2. Go to Concierge Hub
3. Click "View My Plan" button on Cost Planner tile
4. Expected: Opens Financial Assessment Hub
5. Expected: All saved assessment data visible
6. Expected: Can edit/modify existing responses
```

### Test 2: Review Assessment ✅
```
1. Cost Planner complete
2. Click "👁️ Review Assessment" button
3. Expected: Opens Cost Review page
4. Expected: Shows raw JSON data
5. Expected: Shows all calculations, expert review
```

### Test 3: Restart ✅
```
1. Cost Planner complete
2. Click "↻ Restart" button
3. Expected: Opens Quick Estimate intro page
4. Expected: Form fields are empty/reset

- Not Started (first time)
- In Financial Assessment (actively working)

Expected: Only primary/secondary buttons visible
Expected: No errors or empty buttons
```

## Technical Notes

### Why Query Params Instead of State Manipulation?

**Considered:** Directly setting `st.session_state.cost_v2_step = "intro"` before navigation

**Problem:**
- Streamlit reruns happen after navigation
- State changes in one render don't affect navigation target
- Would require complex coordination

**Better approach:** Query params
- Clean, explicit intent
- URL reflects current state
- Bookmarkable
- Works with Streamlit's navigation model

### Why Tertiary Button Was Already Implemented?

The tertiary button support was added earlier for other products that needed 3+ actions. The infrastructure was complete but unused by Cost Planner.

This fix leverages existing functionality rather than adding new complexity! 🎉

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. User navigates directly to `?page=cost_v2&step=assessments`
```
Result: Opens assessments step correctly
Reason: Query param overrides default step selection
```

### 2. User manually types `?page=cost_v2&step=invalid_step`
```
Result: Ignored, falls back to default step detection
Reason: step_from_query validation checks against allowed steps
```

### 3. User clicks "View My Plan" when not complete
```
Result: Button doesn't appear (only shows when is_complete=True)
Reason: tertiary_button_label only set in is_complete branch
```

### 4. User clicks "Restart" multiple times
```
Result: Each click clears state and shows fresh form
Reason: _handle_restart_if_needed() runs on every load when step=intro AND complete=true
```

## UX Improvements

### Before:
- **Primary**: Review Assessment (developer-focused)
- **Secondary**: Restart → went to wrong page ❌

**Problems:**
- Most common action (viewing/editing plan) required manual navigation
- Restart didn't work correctly
- No clear way to get back to assessments

### After:
- **Primary**: View My Plan (user-focused) ✅
- **Secondary**: Review Assessment (developer-focused) ✅
- **Tertiary**: Restart (destructive, clearly labeled) ✅

**Benefits:**
- Most common action is most prominent
- All three actions clearly labeled
- Each button goes to correct destination
- No confusion about what each button does

## Related Issues Fixed

### Issue: Restart went to summary instead of quick estimate
**Root cause:** Used `summary['route']` which returned the last completed step

**Fix:** Explicitly set `?page=cost_v2&step=intro` to force intro step
