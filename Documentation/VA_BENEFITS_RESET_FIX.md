# VA Benefits Reset Fix - Complete

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Branch:** `feature/calculation-verification`  
**Issue:** VA disability values don't clear when user changes from "Yes" to "No"  
**Status:** âœ… Fixed

---

## Problem

When a user:
1. Selects "Do you have VA disability?" = "Yes"
2. Fills in disability rating and dependents
3. System calculates monthly payment (e.g., $1,908.95)
4. User changes back to "No"

**Expected:** All VA disability fields clear (rating, dependents, monthly amount)  
**Actual (BEFORE FIX):** Values remained populated, continued showing in calculations

---

## Solution Implemented

Added reset logic that triggers when user changes disability status from "Yes" to "No":

### Code Change

**File:** `products/cost_planner_v2/assessments.py`

```python
# In _render_section_content, VA disability section:

# NEW: If user changes "Yes" to "No", clear all VA disability values
if not has_disability:
    # Clear rating, dependents, and monthly amount
    if state.get("va_disability_rating") is not None or state.get("va_dependents") is not None or state.get("va_disability_monthly") not in (None, 0, 0.0):
        state["va_disability_rating"] = None
        state["va_dependents"] = None
        state["va_disability_monthly"] = 0.0
        
        # Clear widget session state by removing keys (let widgets reinitialize with defaults)
        st.session_state.pop("field_va_disability_rating", None)
        st.session_state.pop("field_va_dependents", None)
        
        # Clear tracking variables
        st.session_state.pop("_va_prev_rating", None)
        st.session_state.pop("_va_prev_dependents", None)
        
        # Trigger rerun to show cleared values
        st.rerun()
```

## What Gets Cleared

When user changes from "Yes" to "No":

1. **`va_disability_rating`** â†’ `None`
2. **`va_dependents`** â†’ `None`
3. **`va_disability_monthly`** â†’ `0.0`
4. **Widget session state** â†’ Reset to defaults
5. **Tracking variables** â†’ Removed

---

## User Flow

### Scenario: User Changes Mind About VA Disability

**Steps:**
1. Open VA Benefits assessment
2. Select "Do you have VA disability?" = "Yes"
3. Rating field and Dependents field appear
4. Enter 70% disability rating
5. Select "Veteran with spouse" for dependents
6. Monthly VA Disability Payment calculates: $1,908.95
7. User realizes they answered incorrectly
8. Change "Do you have VA disability?" back to "No"

**Result:**
- âœ… Rating field disappears (hidden by visibility rules)
- âœ… Dependents field disappears (hidden by visibility rules)
- âœ… Monthly payment field disappears (hidden by visibility rules)
- âœ… All values reset to zero/null in saved state
- âœ… Widget session state cleared
- âœ… If user changes back to "Yes" later, fields are blank (no stale data)

---

## Integration with Other Features

### Works With Immediate Refresh
This fix integrates with the immediate refresh feature:
- When user changes to "No", values clear immediately (no second click)
- When user changes back to "Yes", fields appear empty and ready for input
- When user enters new values, calculation happens immediately

### Works With Save/Restore
- Cleared values persist correctly when assessment is saved
- If user returns to assessment later, values remain cleared
- No risk of stale data persisting across sessions

### Works With Expert Review
- When VA disability = "No", monthly amount = $0
- Expert review correctly shows no VA benefits in income
- Financial gap calculation excludes VA benefits

---

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Clear on Change to "No" âœ…

**Steps:**
1. VA disability = "Yes"
2. Rating = 70%
3. Dependents = "Veteran with spouse"
4. Monthly payment shows $1,908.95
5. Change disability = "No"

**Expected:** All values clear, fields hidden  
**Result:** âœ… PASS - All cleared immediately

### Test Case 2: Re-entering After Clear âœ…

**Steps:**
1. VA disability = "Yes", enter values
2. Change to "No" (values clear)
3. Change back to "Yes"

**Expected:** Fields appear empty, ready for new input  
**Result:** âœ… PASS - No stale data

### Test Case 3: Save After Clear âœ…

**Steps:**
1. VA disability = "Yes", enter values
2. Change to "No" (values clear)
3. Save assessment
4. Navigate away
5. Return to VA Benefits

**Expected:** Disability = "No", all fields cleared  
**Result:** âœ… PASS - Cleared state persists

### Test Case 4: Expert Review After Clear âœ…

**Steps:**
1. VA disability = "Yes", monthly = $1,908.95
2. Go to Expert Review (shows VA benefits in income)
3. Return to VA Benefits
4. Change to "No"
5. Go to Expert Review again

**Expected:** VA benefits = $0, not included in total income  
**Result:** âœ… PASS - Expert review updates correctly

## Edge Cases Handled

### âœ… Partial Data Entry
**Scenario:** User enters rating but not dependents, then changes to "No"  
**Result:** Both rating and dependents clear correctly

### âœ… Multiple Changes
**Scenario:** User toggles Yes â†’ No â†’ Yes â†’ No multiple times  
**Result:** Values clear each time, no cumulative issues

### âœ… Widget vs State Sync
**Scenario:** Value exists in widget session state but not saved state  
**Result:** Both widget and saved state clear correctly

### âœ… Tracking Variable Cleanup
**Scenario:** User has tracking variables set, then changes to "No"  
**Result:** Tracking variables removed, no false change detection

- âœ… **Confidence:** Users trust that "No" means zero benefits
- âœ… **Error recovery:** Easy to correct mistakes

### Data Integrity

## Pattern for Future Use

### Resetting Dependent Fields

When you have a main toggle/selector that controls visibility of dependent fields:

```python
# Check if toggle is "off"
if not main_field_enabled:
    # Check if any dependent fields have data
    if any_dependent_has_data:
        # Clear all dependent fields in saved state
        for field_key in dependent_field_keys:
            state[field_key] = None  # or 0, 0.0, "", etc.
        
        # Clear widget session state
        for field_key in dependent_field_keys:
            widget_key = f"field_{field_key}"
            if widget_key in st.session_state:
                st.session_state[widget_key] = default_value
        
        # Clear any tracking variables
        for tracking_key in tracking_keys:
            st.session_state.pop(tracking_key, None)
        
        # Trigger rerun to show cleared UI
        st.rerun()
```

### Guidelines

1. **Check before clearing:** Only clear if data actually exists (avoid unnecessary reruns)
2. **Clear both states:** Widget session state AND saved state
3. **Remove widget keys:** Use `st.session_state.pop(key, None)` instead of setting to default values (prevents type errors)
4. **Clear tracking:** Remove any related tracking variables
5. **Trigger rerun:** Force UI update with `st.rerun()`
6. **Let widgets reinitialize:** By removing keys, widgets will use their default values on next render

- va_dependents â†’ None
- va_disability_monthly â†’ 0.0
- Widget session state for rating and dependents
- Tracking variables (_va_prev_rating, _va_prev_dependents)

Benefits:
- Clean slate when user changes mind about VA disability
- No stale data persists in calculations or reports
- Expert review shows correct $0 for VA benefits when disabled
- Immediate clearing (no second interaction needed)

Affects: VA Benefits assessment
