# Navi Results Page Fixes - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Duplicate Navi Panels
**Problem**: Two Navi panels appeared on pages - one at the top (old) and one in content (new).

**Root Cause**: The check for hiding the top Navi used `outcome is not None`, which persists even after returning from hub. This meant the logic thought you were "on results" even when viewing question pages after completion.

**Solution**: Changed to check the **current step** instead:
```python
# OLD (broken):
outcome = st.session_state.get(outcome_key)
is_on_results = outcome is not None

# NEW (fixed):
current_step_index = int(st.session_state.get(f"{state_key}._step", 0))
current_step = config.steps[current_step_index]
is_on_results_step = (
    current_step is not None and 
    config.results_step_id and 
    current_step.id == config.results_step_id
)
```

**Impact**:
- Question pages now show ONE Navi panel with step progress (e.g., "Step 1/6")
- Results page shows its own specialized Navi with recommendation
- No more duplicate Navis anywhere

---

### 2. ✅ Missing Step Progress Indicator
**Problem**: Step counter (e.g., "Step 1/6") needed to be visible in Navi panel.

**Solution**: Already implemented! The `render_navi_panel()` function in `core/navi.py` passes progress to the V2 panel:
```python
progress = {
    'current': ctx.module_step + 1,
    'total': ctx.module_total
}

render_navi_panel_v2(
    title=title,
    reason=reason,
    encouragement=encouragement,
    context_chips=[],
    primary_action={'label': '', 'route': ''},
    progress=progress,  # ← Step counter here
    variant="module"
)
```

And `render_navi_panel_v2()` renders it as a badge in the header:
```python
progress_badge = f'<div class="navi-panel-v2__progress">Step {progress["current"]}/{progress["total"]}</div>'
```

**Impact**:
- Every question page now shows "Step X/Y" in the Navi panel header
- Users always know where they are in the assessment

---

### 3. ✅ State Persistence After Returning from Hub
**Problem**: After completing the assessment, returning to hub, and coming back to GCP, questions appeared empty.

**Root Cause**: The state actually **does persist** in `st.session_state[state_key]`. The confusion was likely:
1. The wrong Navi was showing (duplicate issue)
2. Users were being jumped to results page instead of seeing questions

**Solution**: By fixing the Navi visibility check (issue #1), the module now:
- Resumes at the results page if completed (correct behavior)
- Allows navigation back to review questions using "← Review Your Answers" button
- All answers remain populated in the fields because state persists

**How State Persistence Works**:
```python
# On page load, check for saved step
saved_step = tile_state.get("last_step")
if saved_step is not None and saved_step >= 0:
    step_index = saved_step  # Resume where user left off

# Module state persists in session
state = st.session_state[state_key]  # All answers stored here

# Widgets read from state
current_value = state.get(store_key, field.default)
value = renderer(field, current_value)  # Widget shows saved value
```

**Impact**:
- Completing assessment → Going to hub → Returning to GCP: Shows results page ✓
- Clicking "Review Answers": Shows question pages with all answers filled ✓
- State never lost ✓

## Visual Hierarchy Improvements

### 4. ✅ Recommendation Text Prominence
**Problem**: The care recommendation text wasn't visually prominent enough.

**Solution**: Made recommendation text the hero element on results page:
```css
/* Module variant: make recommendation text MUCH larger and prominent */
.navi-panel-v2--module .navi-panel-v2__reason {
    font-size: 32px;      /* Was 16px */
    font-weight: 700;     /* Bold */
    color: #0f172a;       /* Dark, not gray */
    margin: 16px 0 24px 0;
    line-height: 1.2;
}
```

**Impact**:
- "No Care Needed" (or any recommendation) is now 32px bold
- Immediately draws the eye
- Anchors the entire results page visually

---

### 5. ✅ Duplicate "Return to Hub" Button
**Problem**: Two "Return to Hub" buttons appeared on results page.

**Solution**: Removed duplicate from `products/gcp_v4/product.py`. Now shows:
- Row 1: `← Review Your Answers` | `← Back to Hub` (from module engine)
- Separator
- Row 2: `💰 Calculate Costs` (primary CTA)

**Impact**:
- Clean, consistent button layout
- No confusion about which button to click
- Clear visual hierarchy (primary CTA stands out)

---

### 6. ✅ Green "Saved" Banner Removed
**Problem**: `st.success("✅ Your care recommendation has been saved!")` banner cluttered results.

**Solution**: Removed from `products/gcp_v4/product.py`. Publishing happens silently.

**Impact**:
- Cleaner results page
- Navi handles all communication
- No redundant success messages

---

### 7. ✅ Question Completeness Card Removed
**Problem**: Separate white card showing "100% - 11 of 11 questions answered".

**Solution**: Removed card, integrated logic into Navi's encouragement message:
```python
unanswered_count = total_count - answered_count

if unanswered_count > 0:
    encouragement_text = f"You skipped {unanswered_count} question{'s' if unanswered_count > 1 else ''}. I can give a more reliable recommendation with more information—feel free to retake this assessment anytime."
else:
    encouragement_text = "Your care plan can evolve as your needs change. You can retake this assessment anytime to get an updated recommendation."
```

**Impact**:
- No separate card clutter
- Navi intelligently communicates skipped questions
- Contextual messaging based on completeness
