# Cost Planner Assessment Refactor - Phase 1 Complete

**Branch:** `cp-refactor`  
**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Phase 1 Implementation Complete

---

## 📋 Deliverables

### 1. Assessment Engine (`core/assessment_engine.py`)
**Purpose:** Generic JSON-driven renderer for financial assessments

**Features:**
- ✅ Section-based navigation (intro → fields → results)
- ✅ Field types: currency, select, checkbox, multiselect, text, date
- ✅ Conditional field visibility (`visible_if` logic)
- ✅ Two-column layout support
- ✅ Calculation formulas (`sum()` function)
- ✅ Info boxes (success/warning/error/info from JSON)
- ✅ State persistence across sections
- ✅ Navi guidance panel integration
- ✅ Back navigation and "Back to Hub" buttons
- ✅ Results view with summary calculations

**Pattern:** Follows `core/modules/engine.py` architecture

---

### 2. Assessment Hub (`products/cost_planner_v2/assessments.py`)
**Purpose:** Card grid hub for selecting financial assessments

**Features:**
- ✅ Loads all assessment configs from JSON files
- ✅ Displays assessments as clickable cards
- ✅ Progress tracking (Not Started / X% Done / Complete)
- ✅ Conditional visibility based on flags (e.g., `is_veteran`)
- ✅ Required vs optional badges
- ✅ Estimated time display
- ✅ Overall progress bar across all assessments
- ✅ Routes to assessment engine when clicked

**Pattern:** Follows `products/senior_trivia/product.py` hub pattern

---

### 3. Assessment Configurations (6 Stub JSONs)
**Location:** `config/cost_planner_v2/assessments/`

**Created:**
1. ✅ `income.json` - Income Sources (required)
2. ✅ `assets.json` - Assets & Resources (required)
3. ✅ `va_benefits.json` - VA Benefits (conditional: `is_veteran`)
4. ✅ `health_insurance.json` - Health Insurance
5. ✅ `life_insurance.json` - Life Insurance & Annuities
6. ✅ `medicaid_navigation.json` - Medicaid Planning (conditional: `medicaid_eligible`)

**Current State:** Minimal placeholders with 1-2 fields each

**Next Steps:** 
- Populate with full field definitions from `config/cost_planner_v2_modules.json`
- Add calculations, info boxes, conditional logic
- Add help text and validation rules

---

### 4. Validation Schema
**File:** `config/schemas/assessment_v1.schema.json`

**Validates:**
- Required fields: key, title, icon, description, sections
- Field types: currency, select, checkbox, multiselect, text, date
- Section types: intro, form, results
- Conditional visibility rules
- Calculation formulas
- Output contracts

---

### 5. Product Routing Updates
**File:** `products/cost_planner_v2/product.py`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated `_render_modules_step()` → `_render_assessments_step()`
- ✅ Routes to `render_assessment_hub()` instead of old `hub.render()`
- ✅ Support for both "modules" and "assessments" step names (backward compatibility)
- ✅ Updated Navi guidance messages ("assessments" instead of "modules")
- ✅ Updated session state initialization to check for assessment state

---

## 🎯 Architecture Decisions

### State Management
- **Assessment State Key:** `{product_key}_{assessment_key}` (e.g., `cost_planner_v2_income`)
- **Section Tracking:** `{state_key}._section` (current section index)
- **Persistence:** Saved to `tiles[product_key].assessments.{assessment_key}`
- **Backward Compatible:** Old module state keys preserved during transition

### Navigation Flow
1. User clicks "Financial Assessment" on Cost Planner hub
2. Routed to `_render_assessments_step()` → assessment hub
3. User clicks assessment card → sets `{product_key}_current_assessment`
4. Assessment engine renders selected assessment
5. User completes assessment → marks `status = "done"`
6. "Back to Hub" returns to assessment hub
7. All assessments complete → "Expert Review" unlocks

### Design Principles
✅ **Clean & Minimal:** No banners, no over-communication  
✅ **Navi-Central:** All guidance through Navi panel  
✅ **JSON-Only UI:** No hardcoded Streamlit widgets (except engine)  
✅ **Component Reuse:** Existing `.section-card`, `.navi-panel-v2`, etc.  
✅ **Pattern Consistency:** Follows Senior Trivia module hub exactly

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Hub View
- [ ] Assessment hub renders with 6 cards
- [ ] Cards show correct icon, title, description, time estimate
- [ ] Required badges display correctly (Income, Assets marked required)
- [ ] Progress bar shows 0% initially
- [ ] Conditional assessments hidden (VA Benefits, Medicaid)

### Assessment Flow
- [ ] Clicking "Start →" routes to assessment engine
- [ ] Navi panel appears with contextual guidance
- [ ] Section header renders correctly
- [ ] Fields render based on type (currency, select, etc.)
- [ ] "Continue" button validation works (required fields block)
- [ ] "Back" button navigates to previous section
- [ ] "Back to Hub" returns to assessment hub
- [ ] State persists when returning from hub

### State Persistence
- [ ] Answers saved when navigating between sections
- [ ] Progress indicator updates on hub
- [ ] "Resume" button appears for partial completions
- [ ] "Review" button appears for completed assessments
- [ ] State survives session restart (tile persistence)

### Calculations & Results
- [ ] Summary calculations evaluate correctly (sum formula)
- [ ] Results view displays all collected data
- [ ] Results format values correctly (currency, selections)

## 🔄 Next Steps - Phase 2

### Week 2: Full Config Population
1. **Migrate Full Field Definitions**
   - Copy all sections/fields from `cost_planner_v2_modules.json`
   - Test each assessment individually
   - Validate calculations work correctly

2. **Add Conditional Logic**
   - Implement `visible_if` rules between fields
   - Test flag-based assessment visibility
   - Add info boxes with contextual guidance

3. **Expert Review Integration**
   - Add assessment data aggregation in `expert_review.py`
   - Publish `FinancialProfile` to MCIP
   - Test full workflow (intro → exit)

4. **Legacy Cleanup**
   - Delete `products/cost_planner_v2/hub.py`
   - Delete `products/cost_planner_v2/modules/*.py` (6 files)
   - Remove unused imports
