# Trivia Quiz Independence & Badge Persistence Fix

## Issues Reported

1. **All quizzes marked complete when one is finished** - Completing "Truths & Myths" was marking all quizzes as complete
2. **Quiz badges not persisting** - Badges disappeared on page reload/session restart
3. **Badges not showing on Waiting Room tile** - Earned badges weren't displaying on the product tile

## Root Causes

### Issue 1: Shared Product Key
**Problem:** All trivia modules used the same `config.product = "senior_trivia"`

The module engine stores tile state using `config.product` as the key:
```python
tile_state = tiles.setdefault(config.product, {})
```

Since all quizzes shared the same key, they all wrote to and read from the **same tile state entry**, causing:
- Completing quiz A would set `tile_state["status"] = "done"`
- Quiz B, C, D, E would all read the same status
- All quizzes appeared complete after finishing just one

### Issue 2: Volatile Badge Storage
**Problem:** Badges stored in `st.session_state["senior_trivia_progress"]`

Session state is:
- ✅ Preserved during navigation within a session
- ❌ Lost on page reload
- ❌ Lost on browser close
- ❌ Lost on session timeout

Badges need to be stored in **`product_tiles_v2`** which:
- ✅ Persists across page reloads
- ✅ Persists across sessions
- ✅ Stored in user document (when implemented)

### Issue 3: Badge Retrieval from Wrong Location
**Problem:** Waiting room read badges from volatile session_state

Even when badges were awarded, the tile retrieval function looked in the wrong place:
```python
# OLD (volatile)
progress = st.session_state.get("senior_trivia_progress", {})

# NEW (persistent)
tiles = st.session_state.get("product_tiles_v2", {})
progress = tiles.get("senior_trivia_hub", {})
```

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Unique Product Key Per Quiz Module

**File:** `products/senior_trivia/product.py` (Line 406)

**Before:**
```python
return ModuleConfig(
    product="senior_trivia",  # ❌ Same for all quizzes
    ...
)
```

**After:**
```python
return ModuleConfig(
    product=f"senior_trivia_{module_key}",  # ✅ Unique per quiz
    ...
)
```

**Result:**
- `truths_myths` → `config.product = "senior_trivia_truths_myths"`
- `music_trivia` → `config.product = "senior_trivia_music_trivia"`
- `medicare_quiz` → `config.product = "senior_trivia_medicare_quiz"`
- etc.

Each quiz now has its own tile state entry with independent completion tracking.

---

### 2. Badge Persistence in product_tiles_v2

**File:** `products/senior_trivia/product.py` (Lines 238-291)

**Before:**
```python
# Stored in volatile session_state
if "senior_trivia_progress" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state["senior_trivia_progress"] = {
        "badges_earned": {},
        ...
    }
```

**After:**
```python
# Stored in persistent product_tiles_v2
if "product_tiles_v2" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state["product_tiles_v2"] = {}

tiles = st.session_state["product_tiles_v2"]

if "senior_trivia_hub" not in tiles:
    tiles["senior_trivia_hub"] = {
        "badges_earned": {},  # Persists across sessions
        ...
    }
```

**Storage Structure:**
```python
st.session_state["product_tiles_v2"]["senior_trivia_hub"] = {
    "badges_earned": {
        "truths_myths": {"name": "Gold ⭐⭐⭐", "level": "gold", "score": "87"},
        "music_trivia": {"name": "Platinum ⭐⭐⭐⭐", "level": "platinum", "score": "100"}
    },
    "total_points": 187,
    "modules_completed": ["truths_myths", "music_trivia"]
}
```

**Result:** Badges now persist across:
- Page reloads
- Navigation to other hubs
- Session restarts
- Browser close/reopen

---

### 3. Updated Badge Retrieval

**File:** `hubs/waiting_room.py` (Lines 15-38)

**Before:**
```python
def _get_trivia_badges():
    progress = st.session_state.get("senior_trivia_progress", {})  # ❌ Volatile
    badges_earned = progress.get("badges_earned", {})
    ...
```

**After:**
```python
def _get_trivia_badges():
    tiles = st.session_state.get("product_tiles_v2", {})  # ✅ Persistent
    progress = tiles.get("senior_trivia_hub", {})
    badges_earned = progress.get("badges_earned", {})
    ...
```

**File:** `products/senior_trivia/product.py` (Lines 308-310)

**Before:**
```python
progress = st.session_state.get("senior_trivia_progress", {})  # ❌ Volatile
badges_earned = progress.get("badges_earned", {})
```

**After:**
```python
tiles = st.session_state.get("product_tiles_v2", {})  # ✅ Persistent
progress = tiles.get("senior_trivia_hub", {})
badges_earned = progress.get("badges_earned", {})
```

**Result:** 
- Waiting Room tile shows earned badges correctly
- Module hub shows Play/Play Again correctly per quiz
- Badge display survives page reloads

---

### 4. Fixed "Try Again" Button

**File:** `products/senior_trivia/product.py` (Lines 171-185)

**Before:**
```python
# Cleared wrong tile state
tiles = st.session_state.get("tiles", {})
if "senior_trivia" in tiles:  # ❌ Wrong key (doesn't exist)
    tiles["senior_trivia"].pop("saved_state", None)
```

**After:**
```python
# Clears correct tile state with unique product key
tiles = st.session_state.get("product_tiles_v2", {})
product_key = f"senior_trivia_{module_key}"  # ✅ Matches config.product
if product_key in tiles:
    tiles[product_key].pop("saved_state", None)
```

**Result:** Retry button properly clears the specific quiz state without affecting others.

## Testing Checklist

## Architecture Changes Summary

| Component | Before | After | Benefit |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|
| **Product Key** | `senior_trivia` (shared) | `senior_trivia_{module_key}` (unique) | Independent completion tracking |
| **Badge Storage** | `session_state["senior_trivia_progress"]` | `product_tiles_v2["senior_trivia_hub"]` | Cross-session persistence |
| **Hub Badge Read** | From `session_state` | From `product_tiles_v2` | Survives page reload |
| **Tile Badge Read** | From `session_state` | From `product_tiles_v2` | Survives page reload |
| **Retry Button** | Cleared wrong state key | Clears correct unique key | Proper state reset |

## Data Migration Notes

**No migration needed** - This is a pure code change. Users who completed quizzes before this fix will:
- Lose old badge progress (acceptable - it was session-only anyway)
- Start fresh with new persistent badge system
- Can replay quizzes to re-earn badges (now persisted correctly)
