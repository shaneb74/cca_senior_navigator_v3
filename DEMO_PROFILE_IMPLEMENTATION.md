# Demo Profile System Implementation - Complete

**Date**: October 18, 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Testing

## What Changed

### Problem
Demo user profiles were being overwritten on app startup, losing all pre-configured data. Each time John Test logged in, he started with an empty profile instead of the complete GCP + Cost Planner data.

### Solution
Implemented a **protected demo profile system**:
- Demo profiles stored in `data/users/demo/` (read-only, never modified)
- On first login, app copies demo profile to `data/users/` (working copy)
- Session changes save to working copy only
- Next login can optionally start fresh by deleting working copy

## Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **core/session_store.py** - Added demo profile handling
   - `DEMO_DIR = Path("data/users/demo")` - Protected demo directory
   - `is_demo_user(uid)` - Check if UID starts with "demo_"
   - `get_demo_path(uid)` - Get path to protected demo source
   - `load_user(uid)` - Copy from demo/ on first load
   - `reset_demo_user(uid)` - Delete working copy for fresh start

2. **create_demo_john_v2.py** - Updated to save to demo directory
   - Output: `data/users/demo/demo_john_cost_planner.json`
   - Includes behavior notes in output

### New Functions

```python
# Check if user is demo user
is_demo_user("demo_john_cost_planner")  # → True
is_demo_user("anon_12345")              # → False

# Get paths
get_demo_path("demo_john_cost_planner")
# → Path("data/users/demo/demo_john_cost_planner.json")

get_user_path("demo_john_cost_planner")
# → Path("data/users/demo_john_cost_planner.json")

# Load user (automatic copy from demo/ if needed)
user_data = load_user("demo_john_cost_planner")

# Reset to fresh state
reset_demo_user("demo_john_cost_planner")
```

## Current State

### Demo Profile Created
- **Source**: `data/users/demo/demo_john_cost_planner.json` (13.2 KB)
- **Working Copy**: Not yet created (will be copied on first login)
- **Contents**: Complete GCP + Cost Planner data from user's exact working session

### App Running
- **URL**: http://localhost:8501
- **Status**: Running cleanly
- **Ready**: For John Test login testing

## How It Works

### Flow Diagram
```
[User clicks "John Test"]
         ↓
[load_user("demo_john_cost_planner")]
         ↓
[Check: is_demo_user()?] → Yes
         ↓
[Check: working copy exists?]
    No ↓                 Yes → Load working copy
[Check: demo source exists?]
         ↓ Yes
[Copy: demo/ → users/]
         ↓
[Load from working copy]
         ↓
[User sees: Complete GCP + Cost Planner data]
```

### Session Flow
```
Login #1:
  - No working copy exists
  - Copies from demo/demo_john_cost_planner.json
  - Creates data/users/demo_john_cost_planner.json
  - User sees: $6,200/mo income, Assisted Living, 9 flags

User modifies income → $7,000:
  - save_user() called
  - Saves to working copy (data/users/demo_john_cost_planner.json)
  - Demo source unchanged

Refresh browser (same session):
  - Working copy exists
  - Loads working copy
  - User sees: $7,000/mo income (modified)

App restart + Login #2:
  - Working copy still exists
  - Loads existing working copy
  - User sees: $7,000/mo income (persisted)

Manual reset:
  - Delete working copy: rm data/users/demo_john_cost_planner.json
  - Next login copies fresh from demo/
  - User sees: $6,200/mo income (original)
```

## Testing Steps

### 1. Verify Demo Source Exists
```bash
ls -lh data/users/demo/demo_john_cost_planner.json
# Should show: 13K file
```

### 2. Verify No Working Copy Yet
```bash
ls data/users/demo_john_cost_planner.json 2>/dev/null
# Should show: No such file (doesn't exist yet)
```

### 3. Test First Login
1. Navigate to: http://localhost:8501
2. Go to login page (or find John Test button)
3. Click "John Test" button
4. **Expected**: App logs show "Loading fresh demo profile from: data/users/demo/demo_john_cost_planner.json"
5. **Expected**: Profile loads with complete data

### 4. Verify Working Copy Created
```bash
ls -lh data/users/demo_john_cost_planner.json
# Should now exist: 13K file
```

### 5. Test Data Integrity
- **GCP**: Should show Assisted Living (18 points, 73% confidence)
- **Flags**: Should show 9 care flags
- **Income**: Should show $6,200/mo total
- **Assets**: Should show $195,000 net

### 6. Test Session Persistence
1. Make a change (e.g., modify income)
2. Refresh browser
3. **Expected**: Change is still there (saved to working copy)

### 7. Test Fresh Start
```bash
# Delete working copy
rm data/users/demo_john_cost_planner.json

# Login again
# Expected: Fresh copy from demo/, back to original $6,200
```

### 8. Verify Source Protected
```bash
# Check demo source is unchanged
cat data/users/demo/demo_john_cost_planner.json | jq '.cost_v2_modules.income.data.total_monthly_income'
# Should always show: 6200

# Even after session modifications
cat data/users/demo_john_cost_planner.json | jq '.cost_v2_modules.income.data.total_monthly_income'
# May show different value if modified during session
```

## Commands

### Create/Update Demo Profile
```bash
pkill -9 streamlit
python3 create_demo_john_v2.py
streamlit run app.py
```

### Reset Demo User
```bash
# Option 1: Manual
rm data/users/demo_john_cost_planner.json

# Option 2: Programmatic (future)
from core.session_store import reset_demo_user
reset_demo_user("demo_john_cost_planner")
```

### Verify Demo System
```bash
# List demo sources
ls -lh data/users/demo/

# List working copies
ls -lh data/users/demo_*.json

# Compare demo source to working copy
diff data/users/demo/demo_john_cost_planner.json \
     data/users/demo_john_cost_planner.json
```

## Benefits

### 1. Protected Baseline
- Demo source never modified by app
- Always have clean, known-good profile
- Safe for presentations and testing

### 2. Fresh Start Option
- Delete working copy → get fresh start
- No need to manually restore data
- Automated via `reset_demo_user()`

### 3. Session Flexibility
- Users can interact normally during session
- Changes are saved (to working copy)
- Doesn't break demo flow or UX

### 4. Multiple Demo Users
- Easy to add more: `demo_maria_memory.json`, `demo_robert_veteran.json`
- Each gets own protected source + working copy
- Naming convention: `demo_<name>_<focus>`
