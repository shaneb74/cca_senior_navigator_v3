## 📝 Implementation Details

### **New Files/Functions**

#### `assessments.py`
- **`render_assessment_page(assessment_key, product_key)`**  
  Main function that renders a complete assessment on one page:
  - Loads assessment config from JSON
  - Displays header with title, icon, description
  - Renders intro section with help text and info boxes
  - Renders ALL field sections at once (no clicking between sections)
  - Handles two-column layouts
  - Auto-saves field values on changes
  - Calculates and displays results (sum formulas)
  - Shows navigation buttons at bottom

- **`_render_fields_for_page(section, state)`**  
  Renders all fields for a section in page mode:
  - Supports two-column layouts
  - Handles conditional visibility
  - Returns updated field values
  - Uses existing `_render_single_field()` from assessment_engine

- **`_render_single_info_box(info_box)`**  
  Renders a single info box (success, warning, error, info variants)

- **`_render_page_navigation(assessment_key, product_key, assessment_config)`**  
  Smart navigation at page bottom:
  - Determines previous/next assessments based on order
  - Filters based on flags (veteran, medicaid_interest)
  - Shows "← Previous Assessment" and "Next Assessment →" buttons
  - Shows "🚀 Expert Review" bypass on middle pages (if required complete)
  - Shows "🚀 Go to Expert Review →" on last page (prominent, primary button)
  - Validates required assessments (Income + Assets) before Expert Review

#### `product.py`
- **`_render_assessment_page_step(assessment_key)`**  
  Routing function to render a specific assessment page
  
- **Updated routing logic** to handle `assessment_{key}` step names:
  ```python
  elif current_step.startswith("assessment_"):
      assessment_key = current_step.replace("assessment_", "")
      _render_assessment_page_step(assessment_key)
  ```

#### `triage.py`
- **Updated to route to `assessment_income`** instead of `modules` hub

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

### **Fewer Clicks**
- **Before:** Hub → Card → Intro → Continue → Section 1 → Continue → Section 2 → Continue → ... → Results → Back to Hub → Repeat

**Click reduction:** ~40-50 clicks eliminated across all 6 assessments!

- No excessive button tapping
- Less jarring navigation

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### **Preserved Features**
- ✅ JSON-driven assessment configs (no code changes needed)
- ✅ Conditional field visibility (all logic intact)
- ✅ Two-column layouts (Assets page)
- ✅ Formula calculations (sum formulas work)
- ✅ Info boxes (all 19 render correctly)
- ✅ State persistence (tiles system unchanged)
- ✅ MCIP integration (no impact)
- ✅ Flag-based visibility (veteran, medicaid_interest)

### **Backward Compatibility**
- Old `assessments` hub step still works (for testing)
- Can switch between hub mode and page mode by changing routing
- Old assessment_engine.py untouched (used for field rendering)

### **Assessment Order**
Hardcoded in `_render_page_navigation()`:
```python
assessment_order = [
    "income",
    "assets", 
    "health_insurance",
    "life_insurance",
    "va_benefits",        # Conditional: requires is_veteran flag
    "medicaid_navigation"  # Conditional: requires medicaid_planning_interest flag
]
```

Income and Assets are required. Others are optional.

## 📞 Questions?

- **Where's the hub?** Old hub still exists at `render_assessment_hub()` but not used in new flow. Can be accessed by setting `cost_v2_step = "assessments"`.
- **Can I go back to hub mode?** Yes! Just change routing in product.py back to use `_render_assessments_step()` instead of page-based routing.
- **What if I want to reorder assessments?** Edit the `assessment_order` list in `_render_page_navigation()`.
- **What about the bypass buttons?** One "🚀 Expert Review" button appears on each page (except first 2) if required assessments complete. Prominent button on last page.

**Status:** ✅ Implementation complete, ready for comprehensive testing!

**Test the new flow:**
1. Start Streamlit: `streamlit run app.py`
2. Navigate to Cost Planner
3. Complete intro → auth → triage
4. Experience the new page-based flow!
