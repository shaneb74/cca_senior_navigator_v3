# Assets Aggregate Display Feature - Implementation Complete

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Branch:** `feature/calculation-verification`  
**Feature:** Display aggregate totals as labels instead of editable fields  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented and Ready for Testing

---

## Overview

Implemented smart aggregate field type (`display_currency_aggregate`) that automatically switches between:
- **Basic Mode:** Editable input (user enters their own estimate)
- **Advanced Mode:** Display-only label (calculated from sub-fields in real-time)

This eliminates user confusion about which fields to fill out and prevents duplicate data entry.

---

## Problem Statement

### Before Fix

**User Confusion:**
- Aggregate "Total" fields appeared as editable textboxes
- Users thought they needed to manually enter totals even when filling out detailed breakdowns
- Unclear whether to fill "Total" OR detailed fields, or both
- No visual distinction between user-input fields and calculated aggregates

**Example Scenario:**
```
User sees:
- Checking & Savings (Total): [____]  ← Looks like I should enter something
- Checking: [____]
- Savings/CDs: [____]

User thinks: "Do I enter $50,000 in Total? Or $30k + $20k in the breakdown? Or both?"
```

---

## Solution Implemented

### Smart Aggregate Field Type

Created `display_currency_aggregate` field type that:
1. **Detects mode** by checking if sub-fields have data
2. **Basic mode**: Renders as editable number input
3. **Advanced mode**: Renders as styled display label showing calculated total

### Visual Design

**Basic Mode (Editable):**
```
Checking & Savings (Total)
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ 50000                 [-][+]│ ← Standard number input
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Advanced Mode (Display-Only):**
```
Checking & Savings (Total)
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Total: $50,000.00           │ ← Blue styled label, right-aligned
└─────────────────────────────┘
                              ↑ No input controls, purely display
```

**Styling Details:**
- Background: Light blue (`#f0f9ff`)
- Border: Blue 2px (`#3b82f6`)
- Text: Dark blue, bold (`#1e40af`, 700 weight)
- Label: "Total:" in uppercase, smaller font
- Value: Large, formatted currency with commas

## Technical Implementation

### 1. New Field Type Handler

**File:** `core/assessment_engine.py`

**Added:** `display_currency_aggregate` field type handler (after `display_currency`)

**Logic:**
```python
elif field_type == "display_currency_aggregate":
    # Check if user is in advanced mode
    sub_fields = field.get("aggregate_from", [])
    is_advanced_mode = any(
        new_values.get(sf) or state.get(sf) not in (None, 0, "")
        for sf in sub_fields
    )
    
    if is_advanced_mode:
        # Calculate total from sub-fields
        aggregate_total = sum(sub-field values)
        
        # Render as styled display label
        container.markdown(styled_div)
        
        # Store in state for calculations
        state[key] = aggregate_total
    else:
        # Render as editable number input
        value = container.number_input(...)
        new_values[key] = value
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Real-time calculation from sub-fields
- ✅ Checks `new_values` first (live form data), then `state` (saved data)
- ✅ Handles string/numeric conversions safely
- ✅ Updates state automatically for downstream calculations
- ✅ No user interaction in advanced mode (display-only)

### 2. Assets Configuration Updates

**File:** `products/cost_planner_v2/modules/assessments/assets.json`

**Updated 3 fields:**

#### A. Checking & Savings Total
```json
{
  "key": "cash_liquid_total",
  "label": "Checking & Savings (Total)",
  "type": "display_currency_aggregate",  // Changed from "currency"
  "level": "basic",
  "min": 0,
  "max": 10000000,
  "step": 1000,
  "default": 0,
  "help": "Automatically calculated from Checking + Savings/CDs when using Advanced mode. In Basic mode, enter your best estimate here.",
  "aggregate_from": ["checking_balance", "savings_cds_balance"],  // NEW
  "column": 1
}
```

#### B. Brokerage Total
```json
{
  "key": "brokerage_total",
  "label": "Brokerage / Investments (Total)",
  "type": "display_currency_aggregate",  // Changed from "currency"
  "level": "basic",
  "min": 0,
  "max": 50000000,
  "step": 5000,
  "default": 0,
  "help": "Automatically calculated from Mutual Funds/ETFs + Stocks/Bonds when using Advanced mode. In Basic mode, enter your best estimate here.",
  "aggregate_from": ["brokerage_mf_etf", "brokerage_stocks_bonds"],  // NEW
  "column": 1
}
```

#### C. Retirement Total
```json
{
  "key": "retirement_total",
  "label": "Retirement Accounts (Total)",
  "type": "display_currency_aggregate",  // Changed from "currency"
  "level": "basic",
  "min": 0,
  "max": 50000000,
  "step": 5000,
  "default": 0,
  "help": "Automatically calculated from Traditional IRA/401(k) + Roth IRA when using Advanced mode. In Basic mode, enter your best estimate here.",
  "aggregate_from": ["retirement_traditional", "retirement_roth"],  // NEW
  "column": 1
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Type changed to `display_currency_aggregate`
- ✅ Added `aggregate_from` property listing sub-fields
- ✅ Updated help text to explain dual behavior
- ✅ Kept `min`, `max`, `step` for basic mode input

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: Basic Mode User

**User Action:**
1. Opens Assets assessment
2. Sees "Detail Level: Basic" toggle (default)
3. Sees aggregate totals as editable fields

**What User Sees:**
```
Liquid Assets
├─ Checking & Savings (Total): [50000] ← Can edit
├─ (Checking and Savings/CDs fields hidden in basic mode)

Investments
├─ Brokerage / Investments (Total): [200000] ← Can edit
├─ (MF/ETF and Stocks/Bonds fields hidden in basic mode)

Retirement Accounts
├─ Retirement Accounts (Total): [300000] ← Can edit
├─ (Traditional and Roth fields hidden in basic mode)
```

**Result:**
- User enters 3 totals
- Quick estimate complete
- No confusion about breakdowns

### Scenario 2: Advanced Mode User

**User Action:**
1. Opens Assets assessment
2. Clicks "Advanced" detail level toggle
3. Enters detailed breakdowns

**What User Sees:**
```
Liquid Assets
├─ Checking & Savings (Total): Total: $50,000.00 ← Display only, updates live
├─ Checking: [30000] ← Can edit
├─ Savings/CDs: [20000] ← Can edit

Investments
├─ Brokerage / Investments (Total): Total: $200,000.00 ← Display only
├─ Brokerage - MF/ETFs: [120000] ← Can edit
├─ Brokerage - Stocks/Bonds: [80000] ← Can edit

Retirement Accounts
├─ Retirement Accounts (Total): Total: $350,000.00 ← Display only
├─ Traditional IRA/401(k): [250000] ← Can edit
├─ Roth IRA: [100000] ← Can edit
```

**Real-Time Updates:**
- User enters Checking: $30,000
- User enters Savings: $20,000
- **Total immediately updates to: $50,000.00** ✅
- No manual calculation needed
- Total is display-only (can't edit)

### Scenario 3: Mode Switching

**User Action:**
1. Starts in Basic mode, enters totals
2. Switches to Advanced mode
3. Enters detailed breakdowns

**What Happens:**
```
Basic Mode:
- Cash Total: $50,000 (user entered)

↓ User switches to Advanced

Advanced Mode:
- Cash Total: $50,000.00 (still shows previous value)
- Checking: [____] (empty)
- Savings: [____] (empty)

↓ User enters breakdowns

Advanced Mode (after entry):
- Cash Total: $70,000.00 (now calculated: $40k + $30k)
- Checking: $40,000
- Savings: $30,000
```

**Behavior:**
- ✅ Previous basic mode value preserved initially
- ✅ Once sub-fields have data, aggregate recalculates
- ✅ Clear which mode is active

---

## Calculation Integration

### How Aggregates Work with Total Calculations

**Remember:** From the calculation fixes, the smart calculation logic in `financial_helpers.py` already handles basic vs advanced mode correctly.

**With This Update:**
```python
# In Advanced Mode:
# aggregate_from sub-fields populate: checking_balance, savings_cds_balance
# cash_liquid_total gets auto-calculated and stored in state
# calculate_total_asset_value() uses advanced fields (checking + savings)
# Result: Single source of truth ✅

# In Basic Mode:
# User enters cash_liquid_total directly
# Sub-fields remain empty (0)
# calculate_total_asset_value() uses basic field (cash_liquid_total)
# Result: User estimate respected ✅
```

**No conflicts:** Aggregate display and smart calculation work together seamlessly.

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions

1. **Visual Mode Indicator:**
   ```
   [Total: $50,000.00]  ← Add small badge "Auto-calculated"
   ```

2. **Hover Tooltips:**
   ```
   Hover over total → "Sum of Checking ($30k) + Savings ($20k)"
   ```

3. **Animation:**
   - Subtle transition when total updates
   - Flash briefly to draw attention

4. **Validation Warnings:**
   ```
   If basic total ≠ advanced total:
   "⚠️ Your basic estimate ($50k) differs from detailed total ($55k)"
   ```

5. **Export to Other Assessments:**
   - Income: Apply to "Total Monthly Income" when using advanced breakdowns
   - Can use same `display_currency_aggregate` pattern

## Usage Pattern for Future Assessments

### How to Add Aggregate Display Fields

**Step 1: Define in JSON**
```json
{
  "key": "aggregate_field_total",
  "label": "Category Total",
  "type": "display_currency_aggregate",
  "level": "basic",
  "min": 0,
  "max": 1000000,
  "step": 100,
  "default": 0,
  "help": "Automatically calculated in Advanced mode. Enter estimate in Basic mode.",
  "aggregate_from": ["sub_field_1", "sub_field_2", "sub_field_3"],
  "column": 1
}
```

**Step 2: Define Sub-Fields**
```json
{
  "key": "sub_field_1",
  "label": "Detail A",
  "type": "currency",
  "level": "advanced",
  ...
},
{
  "key": "sub_field_2",
  "label": "Detail B",
  "type": "currency",
  "level": "advanced",
  ...
}
```

**Step 3: Test**
- Basic mode: Aggregate is editable
- Advanced mode: Aggregate is display-only calculated total
- Real-time updates work

**That's it!** The assessment engine handles everything automatically.

feat(cost-planner): Add smart aggregate display for asset totals

Implemented display_currency_aggregate field type that automatically
switches between editable input (Basic mode) and display-only calculated
label (Advanced mode) based on whether sub-fields have data.

Features:
- Basic mode: Aggregate fields editable (quick estimate entry)
- Advanced mode: Aggregate fields display-only (calculated from sub-fields)
- Real-time updates when sub-fields change
- Styled blue display label distinguishes calculated vs input fields
- No user interaction possible in advanced mode (display-only)

Changes:
- assessment_engine.py: Added display_currency_aggregate field type handler
  with mode detection logic and dual rendering
- assets.json: Updated 3 aggregate fields (cash_liquid_total,
  brokerage_total, retirement_total) to use new type with aggregate_from
  property listing sub-fields

Benefits:
- Eliminates user confusion about which fields to fill
- Prevents duplicate data entry
- Clear visual distinction between input and calculated fields
- Maintains flexibility for both basic and advanced users
