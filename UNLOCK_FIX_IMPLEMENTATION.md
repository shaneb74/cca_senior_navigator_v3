# ✅ Unlock Logic Fix - Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED & TESTED  
**Impact**: CRITICAL BUG FIX

---

## 🎯 Problem Fixed

**Issue**: Completing GCP unlocked Cost Planner temporarily, but returning to hub caused Cost Planner to lock again, asking user to "Complete Guided Care Plan first" even though it was already done.

**Root Cause**: Unlock logic checked legacy session state (`st.session_state["gcp"]["progress"]`) but GCP v4 publishes only to MCIP (`st.session_state["mcip"]["journey"]["completed_products"]`).

---

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Unlock Logic (core/product_tile.py)

**Modified Function**: `_evaluate_requirement(req, state)`

**Changes**:
- Added MCIP import and completion check
- Checks `MCIP.is_product_complete()` FIRST for modern products
- Falls back to legacy `_get_progress()` for backward compatibility
- Maps product keys to MCIP IDs: `gcp`, `cost`/`cost_planner`/`cost_v2`, `pfma`/`pfma_v2`

**Code**:
```python
if key in ("gcp", "cost", "pfma", "cost_planner", "pfma_v2", "cost_v2"):
    product_map = {
        "gcp": "gcp",
        "cost": "cost_planner",
        "cost_planner": "cost_planner",
        "cost_v2": "cost_planner",
        "pfma": "pfma_v2",
        "pfma_v2": "pfma_v2"
    }
    
    if spec == "complete":
        # FIRST: Check MCIP (authoritative source)
        try:
            from core.mcip import MCIP
            product_id = product_map.get(key, key)
            if MCIP.is_product_complete(product_id):
                return True
        except Exception:
            pass
        
        # FALLBACK: Check legacy session state
        prog = _get_progress(state, key)
        return prog >= 100
```

**Result**: Unlock logic now reads from MCIP, the single source of truth for completion state.

---

### 2. Verified Persistence (Already Working)

**Confirmed**:
- ✅ MCIP saves contracts to `st.session_state["mcip_contracts"]`
- ✅ `session_store.py` includes `"mcip_contracts"` in `USER_PERSIST_KEYS`
- ✅ `app.py` calls `save_user()` with extracted state after each page render
- ✅ MCIP.initialize() restores from `mcip_contracts` on app startup
- ✅ Journey state (completed_products, unlocked_products) persists

**Persistence Flow**:
```python
# 1. GCP completes → publishes to MCIP
MCIP.mark_product_complete("gcp")

# 2. MCIP saves to session state
st.session_state["mcip_contracts"]["journey"]["completed_products"] = ["gcp"]

# 3. app.py extracts user state (after page render)
user_state = extract_user_state(st.session_state)  # Includes mcip_contracts

# 4. app.py saves to disk
save_user(uid, user_state)  # → data/users/<uid>.json

# 5. On next app load, app.py restores
user_data = load_user(uid)
merge_into_state(st.session_state, user_data)

# 6. MCIP.initialize() reads mcip_contracts
MCIP.initialize()  # Restores journey from mcip_contracts
```

**File**: `data/users/<uid>.json` contains:
```json
{
  "uid": "anon_abc123",
  "mcip_contracts": {
    "journey": {
      "completed_products": ["gcp"],
      "unlocked_products": ["gcp", "cost_planner", "pfma"]
    },
    "care_recommendation": { ... },
    "financial_profile": null,
    "advisor_appointment": null
  },
  "profile": { ... },
  "tiles": { ... }
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Performed

### Test 1: MCIP Unlock Logic
```bash
$ python test_unlock_fix.py

✓ MCIP initialized
✓ Marked GCP as complete
✓ MCIP.is_product_complete('gcp') = True
✓ _evaluate_requirement('gcp:complete', state) = True
✓ _evaluate_requirement('cost:complete', state) = False

✅ All tests passed!
```

### Test 2: MCIP Persistence
```bash
✓ mcip_contracts exists in session_state
✓ Journey state saved to mcip_contracts
✓ USER_PERSIST_KEYS includes mcip_contracts
✓ Extracted user state includes mcip_contracts
✓ Saved to data/users/test_xxx.json
✓ Journey state persisted and restored correctly

✅ All persistence tests passed!
```

### Test 3: Full Flow (E2E)
```bash
Step 1: Fresh User - Cost Planner Locked ✓
Step 2: Complete GCP → Cost Planner Unlocked ✓
Step 3: Save User Data to Disk ✓
Step 4: Simulate App Restart (Clear Session) ✓
Step 5: Restore User Data from Disk ✓
Step 6: Reinitialize MCIP ✓
Step 7: Verify Cost Planner Still Unlocked ✓

✅ Full flow test passed! Unlock state persists across sessions!
```

## 🔍 Debug Commands

### Check User File
```bash
# Find your user file
ls -lh data/users/

# View contents
cat data/users/anon_<your_id>.json | python -m json.tool
```

### Check MCIP State in App
```python
# Add to any page
import streamlit as st
from core.mcip import MCIP

st.write("MCIP State:", st.session_state.get("mcip"))
st.write("MCIP Contracts:", st.session_state.get("mcip_contracts"))
st.write("GCP Complete:", MCIP.is_product_complete("gcp"))
st.write("Cost Complete:", MCIP.is_product_complete("cost_planner"))
```

## 📊 Impact Assessment

### Fixed Issues ✅
- Cost Planner re-locking after GCP completion
- PFMA re-locking after Cost Planner completion
- Completion state lost between hub navigations
- Progress not persisting across app restarts
- Unlock requirements not checking MCIP

### Unaffected Behavior ✅
- Internal product navigation (already working)
- Legacy products (fall back to session state)
- Module-to-module navigation (no unlock checks)
- Session state structure (no breaking changes)

### Performance Impact ⚡
- Negligible (one MCIP check per tile render)
- No additional disk I/O (persistence already exists)
- Backward compatible (no migration needed)

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Single Source of Truth**: MCIP is the authoritative completion tracker. Don't check multiple locations.

2. **Migration Patterns**: When moving to new architecture, update ALL consumers of old data (not just publishers).

3. **Fallback Logic**: Include backward compatibility for graceful migration.

4. **Test Coverage**: Automated tests catch integration issues before manual testing.

5. **Persistence Layer**: Existing infrastructure often already handles new requirements - verify before adding new systems.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

### Phase 2: Remove Legacy Fallback
Once all products use MCIP exclusively:
```python
# Remove legacy _get_progress() check
# Simplify to MCIP-only
if spec == "complete":
    return MCIP.is_product_complete(product_id)
```

### Phase 3: Configuration-Driven Unlocks
Move unlock requirements to config file:
```json
{
  "cost_v2": {
    "unlock_requires": ["gcp:complete"],
    "lock_msg": "Complete Guided Care Plan first"
  }
}
```

### Phase 4: Real-Time Sync
Add event listeners to update unlock state when MCIP changes:
```python
@MCIPEventBus.on("mcip.product.completed")
def on_product_complete(event):
    # Refresh tile lock states
    pass
```
