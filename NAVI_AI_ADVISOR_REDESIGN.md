## What Changed

### 1. **Page Identity & Branding**
- **Title:** "AI Advisor" (clean, professional)
- **Intro:** "I'm Navi ‚Äî your expert advisor."
- **Contextual Description:** "Ask about care options, costs, benefits, and next steps. I'll point you to the right tools."
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Clear H1 ‚Üí Subhead ‚Üí Description structure
- **Navi's Blue:** `#4A90E2` used for intro text and UI accents without overwhelming the page

### 2. **Suggested Questions (Refreshable Chips)**
- **Display:** 3-6 question chips in responsive grid
- **Behavior:** Click ‚Üí Submit question ‚Üí Auto-refresh chip set with new questions
- **Smart Rotation:** 
  - Tracks recently asked questions (last 10)
  - Avoids duplicates
  - Resets pool when user has asked most questions
- **Topics:** Each question tagged by topic (planning, safety, veterans, costs, benefits)

### 3. **Ask Me Anything (Fake GPT Flow)**
- **Text Input:** Clean input field with placeholder guidance
- **Send Button:** Primary action button (supports Enter key)
- **Clear Chat:** Resets conversation for current session only
- **Typing Indicator:** "‚ú® Navi is thinking..." for 600-900ms before response
- **Keyword Matching:** Maps user input to templated answers from question database
- **Fallback Response:** Helpful default when no match found, with topic suggestions

### 4. **Response Quality**
- **Format:** Short, skimmable, action-oriented (bullets > paragraphs)
- **Cross-Links:** Every response includes at least one module reference
  - Example: "Check eligibility with the VA Benefits module in Cost Planner."
- **Structure:**
  - Bold headings for key points
  - Bullet lists for clarity
  - Specific cost ranges and timeframes
  - Clear next actions

### 5. **Minimalist Styling**
- **Layout Width:** 840px max-width, centered content column
- **Clean Hierarchy:**
  - H1: AI Advisor
  - Subhead: "I'm Navi ‚Äî your expert advisor."
  - Sections: Suggested Questions, Ask Me Anything, Questions I've Asked
- **Message Bubbles:**
  - User: Plain text bubble with gray background
  - Navi: Card with ‚ú® icon, soft blue tint (`#F5F8FF`), subtle border
- **Question Chips:** Pill buttons with quiet outline, hover ‚Üí fill effect
- **Whitespace:** Generous vertical rhythm (24-32px between sections)
- **Responsive:** Mobile-optimized with smaller fonts and tighter spacing

### 6. **Behavior Details**
- **Session Persistence:** Conversation history survives page navigation within session
- **Clear Chat:** Wipes only this page's conversation (doesn't affect other app state)
- **Rate Limiting:** Typing indicator prevents rapid-fire spam
- **No Banners:** Clean page with no colored strips or promotional content
- **Accessibility:**
  - Proper ARIA labels for inputs and buttons
  - Visible focus states on interactive elements
  - `prefers-reduced-motion` support (disables animations)

### 7. **Microcopy Excellence**
- **Navi Intro:** "Ask about care options, costs, benefits, and next steps. I'll point you to the right tools."
- **Module Cross-Links:** "Check eligibility with the VA Benefits module in Cost Planner."
- **Guardrail Footer:** "Navi offers information, not medical or legal advice." (subtle, small text)
- **Empty State:** "üí° Click a suggested question above or type your own to start chatting with Navi."

### 8. **Navigation**
- **Back to Hub:** Single button at bottom, full-width, subdued style
- **In-App Navigation:** All links stay in-app (no new tabs)
- **Consistent Routing:** Uses `route_to("hub_concierge")` like other products

## Technical Implementation

### Files Changed

| File | Changes | Lines Changed |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `pages/ai_advisor.py` | ‚ú® NEW - Complete redesign of AI Advisor page | +500 |
| `pages/_stubs.py` | Updated `render_faqs()` to point to new module | 2 |

### Key Components

#### 1. Question Database
```python
QUESTION_DATABASE = {
    "question_key": {
        "question": "Display text",
        "topic": "planning|safety|veterans|costs|benefits",
        "keywords": ["match", "terms"],
        "response": "Formatted markdown response with **bold** and bullets"
    }
}
```

- **12 Core Questions:** Covering care planning, safety, veterans, costs, benefits
- **Topic Tags:** Enable smart grouping and rotation
- **Keyword Matching:** Flexible natural language matching
- **Action-Oriented:** Every response includes module cross-links

#### 2. Suggestion Engine
```python
def _get_suggested_questions(exclude: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    """Get 3-6 suggested questions, excluding recently asked."""
```

- Filters out recently asked questions (tracked in `ai_asked_keys`)
- Shuffles available questions for variety
- Resets pool when < 3 questions available
- Returns 3-6 questions for responsive grid

#### 3. Response Matching
```python
def _match_question(user_input: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
    """Match user input via exact match or keyword matching."""
```

- Try exact question match first
- Fall back to keyword matching
- Return fallback response if no match

#### 4. Typing Indicator
```python
def _render_typing_indicator():
    """Show 'Navi is thinking...' for 600-900ms."""
    with st.spinner("‚ú® Navi is thinking..."):
        time.sleep(random.uniform(0.6, 0.9))
```

- Random delay (600-900ms) feels natural
- Prevents spam by rate-limiting responses

### CSS Architecture

**Custom Classes:**
- `.faq-container` ‚Äî 840px max-width, centered
- `.faq-header` ‚Äî Page title and intro
- `.faq-chip` ‚Äî Suggested question pill button
- `.faq-message--user` ‚Äî User message bubble
- `.faq-message--navi` ‚Äî Navi response card with icon
- `.faq-guardrail` ‚Äî Footer disclaimer

**Design Tokens:**
- Navi Blue: `#4A90E2`
- Navi Background: `#F5F8FF`
- Border: `#E0E7FF`
- Chip Hover Shadow: `rgba(74, 144, 226, 0.15)`

**Animations:**
- `fadeInUp` ‚Äî Message bubbles appear with subtle slide-up
- Chip hover ‚Äî Translate up 1px with shadow
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`

st.session_state["ai_asked_keys"]      # ["question_key", ...]
st.session_state["ai_current_input"]   # User's current input (for clearing)
```

### Persistence

- Curated set of 12 high-quality questions
- Topic-based grouping for chip rotation
- Cleaner keyword matching
- Focus on visual design and UX

### Backward Compatibility
- ‚úÖ `render_faqs()` in `_stubs.py` still works (delegates to new module)
- ‚úÖ Navigation config unchanged (still points to `render_faqs`)
- ‚úÖ Session state keys different (won't conflict with old implementation)

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 (Optional)
1. **Smart Context Detection**
   - Read GCP flags to suggest relevant questions
   - Detect Cost Planner completion to shift question topics

2. **Enhanced Matching**
   - Use fuzzy string matching for better keyword detection
   - Add synonym support (e.g., "Medicaid" vs. "medical aid")

3. **Answer Personalization**
   - Insert user's name from session state
   - Reference their specific care recommendation
   - Show cost estimates from their Cost Planner

4. **Analytics**
   - Track most-asked questions
   - Identify questions with no good match
   - Log user satisfaction (thumbs up/down on responses)

5. **Rich Responses**
   - Add images or diagrams to complex topics
   - Embed video clips for visual learners
   - Link to external resources (articles, tools)

## Design Rationale

### Why This Approach?

#### 1. Minimalist Layout
**Goal:** Let Navi's personality shine without visual clutter.
- Centered 840px column creates comfortable reading width
- Generous whitespace prevents cognitive overload
- Clean hierarchy guides user through page flow

#### 2. Navi's Blue Accent
**Goal:** Brand recognition without overwhelming the page.
- `#4A90E2` used sparingly (intro text, borders, hover states)
- Soft tint (`#F5F8FF`) for Navi response bubbles
- White background keeps page light and airy

#### 3. Chip-Based Suggestions
**Goal:** Encourage exploration without analysis paralysis.
- 3-6 chips provide choice without overwhelming
- One-click action reduces friction
- Auto-refresh keeps experience fresh

#### 4. Typing Indicator
**Goal:** Human-like interaction, rate limiting, anticipation.
- 600-900ms feels natural (not instant, not slow)
- Prevents spam by forcing pause between questions
- Creates anticipation for response

#### 5. Session-Scoped History
**Goal:** Continuity within session, clean slate on new visit.
- User can reference previous answers while exploring
- Clear chat gives control to reset conversation
- No server-side storage needed (privacy-friendly)

## Questions & Feedback

### Design Questions
- Should we add thumbs up/down for response quality?
- Should Clear chat confirm before wiping history?
- Should we persist conversation across sessions (localStorage)?

### Content Questions
- Are 12 questions enough, or should we expand to 20+?
- Should responses be even shorter (more bullet-focused)?
- Should we add "Related Questions" at end of each response?

### Technical Questions
- Should we integrate with real GPT API in future?
- Should we track analytics (question frequency, fallback rate)?
- Should we add search/filter for question database?
