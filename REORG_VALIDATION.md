- products/home_safety → products/waiting_room/home_safety
- products/advisor_prep → products/waiting_room/advisor_prep

- products/disease_mgmt → products/resources/disease_mgmt
- products/home_health → products/resources/home_health
- products/dme → products/resources/dme
- products/med_manage → products/resources/med_manage
- products/gcp_v4 → products/concierge_hub/gcp_v4
- products/cost_planner_v2 → products/concierge_hub/cost_planner_v2

### 2. One helper path only ✅
- Kept: products/resources/resources_common/ (canonical)
- Removed: products/resources_common/ (was shim)
- All imports normalized to: products.resources.resources_common

### 3. Global AI exists ✅
- Created: products/global/ai/advisor_service.py
- Function: get_answer(question, name, tags, source)
- Returns: {answer, sources, cta, meta}
- Wired to: Concierge AI Advisor tile (via pages.faq)

### 4. Admin and shared under products/global ✅
- Moved: products/admin → products/global/admin
- Moved: products/shared → products/global/shared

### 5. Nav.json references hub paths exclusively ✅
All product modules use hub paths:
