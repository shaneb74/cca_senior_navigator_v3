## 📊 Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Planning & Architecture (Complete)
**Goal:** Design JSON-driven assessment system and migration strategy

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Assessment engine architecture (`core/assessment_engine.py`)
- ✅ JSON schema design for assessments
- ✅ Migration plan for 6 financial assessments
- ✅ State management strategy
- ✅ MCIP integration design

**Key Decisions:**
- Use declarative JSON configs for all assessments
- Leverage existing Senior Trivia pattern for hub view
- Support conditional visibility with `visible_if` rules
- Implement formula engine for calculated summaries
- Publish standardized contracts to MCIP (not raw data)

---

### Phase 2: Assessment Migration (Complete)
**Goal:** Migrate all 6 financial assessments from Python to JSON

**Commits:**
- Multiple assessment migrations (income, assets, health insurance, life insurance, VA benefits, medicaid)
- Bug fixes for flag visibility and conditional logic
- Two-column layout implementation

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ **6 assessments migrated** to JSON (1,050+ lines)
- ✅ **41 fields** across all assessments
- ✅ **19 info boxes** with guidance content
- ✅ **4 calculated formulas** (income, assets, life insurance, VA benefits)
- ✅ **14+ conditional visibility patterns**
- ✅ **2 flag-gated assessments** (veteran, medicaid planning)
- ✅ **Multiselect fields** (medicare parts, estate docs)
- ✅ **Two-column layout** for Assets assessment

**Assessment Details:**

| Assessment | Fields | Sections | Info Boxes | Formula | Flags Required |
|------------|--------|----------|------------|---------|----------------|
| Income | 5 | 4 | 5 | ✅ Sum | None |
| Assets | 6 | 3 | 3 | ✅ Sum | None |
| Health Insurance | 13 | 4 | 3 | ❌ Text | None |
| Life Insurance | 8 | 2 | 2 | ✅ Sum | None |
| VA Benefits | 6 | 3 | 2 | ✅ Sum | `is_veteran` |
| Medicaid Planning | 9 | 4 | 4 | ❌ Text | `medicaid_planning_interest` |

**Technical Achievements:**
- Complex conditional visibility (Medicare parts, LTC insurance, annuities, etc.)
- Multiselect widgets with proper state management
- Responsive two-column layouts
- Formula calculation engine
- Flag-based assessment visibility
- Progress tracking and resume functionality

---

### Phase 3: Expert Review Integration (Complete)
**Goal:** Build expert financial analysis with MCIP integration

**Commits:**
- a8db946: FinancialProfile aggregation and expert formulas
- f87def3: Expert Review UI implementation
- 1adc1fb: Navigation button fixes
- a1223b8: CareRecommendation object access fix
- 28692eb: VA disability rating parsing fix
- 95e1265: Cost estimate integration fix
- 2909a7b: Runway prominence fix
- 3ddf37a: MCIP import path fix
- a0a0b17: MCIP integration contract fix (final)

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ **FinancialProfile aggregation** (`financial_profile.py`)
  - Collects all 41 fields from 6 assessments
  - Tracks completion status (required vs optional)
  - Calculates completeness percentage
  - Manages state persistence

- ✅ **Expert formulas** (`expert_formulas.py`)
  - `coverage_percentage`: Income/assets vs estimated cost
  - `monthly_gap`: Shortfall between income and care cost
  - `runway_months`: Months until assets depleted at current burn rate
  - Incorporates care recommendation from GCP when available

- ✅ **Expert Review UI** (`expert_review.py`)
  - 4 metric cards (cost, income, gap, runway)
  - Financial details accordion
  - Action items with next steps
  - Navigation buttons (back to assessments, continue)
  - Prominent runway display with color coding

- ✅ **MCIP Integration**
  - Publishes standardized `FinancialProfile` contract (7 fields)
  - Not raw data - summary metrics only
  - Available to other products via `MCIP.get_financial_profile()`
  - Proper error handling and logging

**MCIP FinancialProfile Contract:**
```python
{
    "estimated_monthly_cost": 9678.0,      # From expert analysis
    "coverage_percentage": 44.0,           # Income/assets vs cost
    "gap_amount": 5428.0,                  # Monthly shortfall
    "runway_months": 7,                    # Months until broke
    "confidence": 0.83,                    # Based on completeness %
    "generated_at": "2025-10-17T...",      # ISO timestamp
    "status": "complete"                   # or "in_progress"
}
```

**Bug Fixes (8 total):**
1. Flag visibility for assessments
2. Button navigation routing
3. MCIP import path correction
4. CareRecommendation object attribute access
5. VA disability rating string parsing
6. Cost estimate integration
7. Runway metric prominence
8. MCIP contract structure (from dict to dataclass)

### Phase 4: Cleanup & Optimization (Complete)
**Goal:** Remove legacy code, optimize structure, prepare for merge

**Commits:**
- 936c0f8: Remove legacy module system (10 files, 3,926 lines deleted)
- 8b23ddf: Reorganize assessment configs for better colocation

**Deliverables:**

#### 4.1-4.2: Legacy Code Removal
**Deleted 10 files (3,926 lines):**
- `products/cost_planner_v2/hub.py` (legacy hub implementation)
- `products/cost_planner_v2/modules/income.py`
- `products/cost_planner_v2/modules/assets.py`
- `products/cost_planner_v2/modules/health_insurance.py`
- `products/cost_planner_v2/modules/life_insurance.py`
- `products/cost_planner_v2/modules/va_benefits.py`
- `products/cost_planner_v2/modules/medicaid_navigation.py`
- `products/cost_planner_v2/modules/coverage.py`
- `products/cost_planner_v2/modules/monthly_costs.py`
- `products/cost_planner_v2/modules/income_assets.py`

**Cleaned up `product.py`:**
- Removed `_render_active_module()` function (42 lines)
- Removed `module_active` case from routing
- Removed all legacy module imports (6 imports)

**Rationale:**
- Legacy Python renderers fully replaced by JSON configs
- `hub.py` never imported (dead code)
- `_render_active_module()` never called (flow uses assessments step)
- Current flow: intro → auth → triage → **assessments** → expert_review → exit

#### 4.3: Config Reorganization
**Moved assessment configs for better colocation:**
```
Before:
config/cost_planner_v2/assessments/    ← Global config directory
  ├── income.json
  └── ...

After:
products/cost_planner_v2/
  ├── modules/
  │   └── assessments/                 ← Product-owned configs
  │       ├── income.json
  │       ├── assets.json
  │       ├── health_insurance.json
  │       ├── life_insurance.json
  │       ├── va_benefits.json
  │       └── medicaid_navigation.json
  ├── assessments.py
  └── product.py
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Better colocation (configs live next to code)
- ✅ Product ownership (not in global config/)
- ✅ Clear namespace (`modules/assessments/`)
- ✅ Future extensibility (can add `modules/templates/`, `modules/schemas/`)
- ✅ Cleaner separation (config/ for app-wide, products/*/modules/ for product-specific)

**Updated `assessments.py`:**
- Changed `_load_all_assessments()` to load from `modules/assessments/`
- Changed `_load_assessment_config()` to load from `modules/assessments/`
- Removed dependency on global `config/` directory

## 🔧 Technical Patterns

### JSON Assessment Schema
```json
{
  "key": "income",
  "title": "Income Sources",
  "icon": "💰",
  "description": "Monthly income from all sources",
  "estimated_time": "2-3 min",
  "sort_order": 1,
  "required": true,
  "visible_if": {
    "flag": "is_veteran",
    "value": true
  },
  "intro": {
    "title": "Let's Review Your Income",
    "icon": "💰",
    "help_text": "...",
    "info_boxes": [...]
  },
  "sections": [
    {
      "key": "social_security",
      "title": "Social Security Benefits",
      "icon": "🏛️",
      "fields": [
        {
          "key": "ss_monthly",
          "label": "Social Security Monthly Benefit",
          "type": "currency",
          "required": true,
          "min": 0,
          "max": 10000,
          "step": 50,
          "default": 0,
          "help_text": "...",
          "visible_if": {
            "field": "has_social_security",
            "value": true
          }
        }
      ],
      "info_boxes": [...],
      "layout": {
        "columns": 2
      }
    }
  ],
  "results": {
    "title": "Income Summary",
    "summary_text": "Total Monthly Income: ${total}/month",
    "formula": {
      "type": "sum",
      "fields": ["ss_monthly", "pension_monthly", "employment_monthly", "other_monthly"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Conditional Visibility Rules
```python
# Flag-based (assessment level)
"visible_if": {
    "flag": "is_veteran",
    "value": true
}

# Field-based (field level)
"visible_if": {
    "field": "has_medicare",
    "value": true
}

# Multiple values (OR logic)
"visible_if": {
    "field": "has_va_benefits",
    "value": ["yes", "applied"]
}
```

### Formula Engine
```python
# Sum formula
"formula": {
    "type": "sum",
    "fields": ["ss_monthly", "pension_monthly", "employment_monthly", "other_monthly"]
}

# Calculated in results view:
total = sum(profile.get(field, 0) for field in formula['fields'])
st.markdown(f"### Total Monthly Income: ${total:,.2f}/month")
```

### MCIP Contract Pattern
```python
# WRONG: Publishing full data dict
MCIP.set("financial_profile", profile_dict)  # ❌ Don't do this

# RIGHT: Publishing standardized contract
from core.mcip import MCIP, FinancialProfile

mcip_profile = FinancialProfile(
    estimated_monthly_cost=analysis.estimated_monthly_cost,
    coverage_percentage=analysis.coverage_percentage,
    gap_amount=analysis.monthly_gap,
    runway_months=int(analysis.runway_months),
    confidence=profile.completeness_percentage / 100.0,
    generated_at=datetime.now().isoformat(),
    status="complete" if profile.required_assessments_complete else "in_progress"
)

MCIP.publish_financial_profile(mcip_profile)  # ✅ Correct
```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Declarative JSON approach:** Made assessments easier to build and maintain
2. **Assessment engine pattern:** Reusable across products (already used by Senior Trivia)
3. **Incremental migration:** Phased approach reduced risk
4. **MCIP contract pattern:** Proper separation of concerns (summary vs raw data)
5. **User testing:** Early validation caught UX issues before completion

### What Could Be Improved
1. **MCIP contract confusion:** Initially tried to publish full data dict (fixed)
2. **Config location:** Took iteration to find optimal structure (now in products/*/modules/)
3. **Testing strategy:** Should have written automated tests earlier
4. **Documentation timing:** Should have documented as we went (not at end)

### Key Takeaways
1. **Declarative > Imperative:** JSON configs much easier to maintain than Python
2. **Colocation matters:** Keep configs close to code that uses them
3. **Contracts are crucial:** Standardized interfaces between products essential
4. **Testing is investment:** Automated tests would have caught bugs faster
5. **Documentation is code:** Good docs as important as good code

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### For Future Developers

**Adding a new assessment:**
1. Create JSON file in `products/cost_planner_v2/modules/assessments/`
2. Follow schema from existing assessments (use `income.json` as template)
3. Add `sort_order` to control position in hub
4. Update `financial_profile.py` if new fields needed in aggregation
5. Update expert formulas if new data affects calculations

**Modifying an existing assessment:**
1. Edit JSON file in `modules/assessments/`
2. No Python code changes needed (declarative!)
3. Test conditional visibility if adding `visible_if` rules
4. Test formulas if changing field keys

**Debugging assessment issues:**
1. Check console for JSON parsing errors
2. Verify field keys match exactly in JSON and session state
3. Test conditional visibility rules with debug prints
4. Check tile state for progress tracking issues

**MCIP integration:**
- Always publish dataclass, not dict
- Only publish summary metrics (7 fields), not raw data
- Use `MCIP.publish_financial_profile()`, not `MCIP.set()`
- Check MCIP state with `st.session_state["mcip"]`

## 🏆 Conclusion

The Cost Planner v2 refactor successfully modernized a critical product feature, removing nearly 4,000 lines of legacy code while improving maintainability, user experience, and cross-product integration. The new JSON-driven assessment system sets a pattern for future product development and demonstrates the value of declarative configuration over imperative code.

**Status:** ✅ Complete and ready for production merge

**Next Steps:**
1. Run final regression testing (Phase 4.4)
2. Create PR and request code review
3. Merge to main and tag v2.0.0
4. Optional: Phase 5 screen consolidation (post-merge)
