# Pre-Push Cleanup Summary
**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Branch:** dev  
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Remote Push

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### ✅ 1. Debug Navigation Entry Removed
- **File:** `config/nav.json`
- **Issue:** Debug GCP page was exposed in app navigation
- **Action:** Removed debug_gcp entry from app_utilities group
- **Impact:** Debug page no longer accessible in production builds

### ✅ 2. Development Tools Relocated
Moved the following files to `dev_tools/` directory (gitignored):
- `add_debug_nav.py` - Utility to add debug page to nav
- `debug_gcp_state.py` - Session state inspection script
- `pages/debug_gcp.py` - Debug page component
- `test_complete_flow.py` - Integration test script

**Rationale:** These are development utilities that should not be in production deployments but are useful to preserve locally.

### ✅ 3. Updated .gitignore
- Added `dev_tools/` to gitignore
- Cleaned up duplicate entries
- Added comment section for clarity

### ✅ 4. Created dev_tools/README.md
- Documented purpose of each tool
- Provided usage instructions
- Clarified that directory is gitignored

## Remaining Known Items

### Low Priority (Documented, No Action Required)

1. **TODO Comment in pages/faq.py (line 305)**
   ```python
   TODO: Replace with actual GPT/LLM integration.
   ```
   - This is a known future enhancement
   - Consider creating a GitHub issue to track

2. **"Temporarily Disabled" Comments**
   - `pages/welcome.py:511` - Logout handler disabled
   - `pages/_stubs.py:714` - Signup function deprecated
   - `layout.py:96` - Role-based navigation disabled
   - `hubs/professional.py:79` - Role-based gating removed
   
   **Status:** These represent intentional feature removals/simplifications, not incomplete work.

3. **Development Utility Active**
   - `products/cost_planner/dev_unlock.py` - Dev utility for unlocking Cost Planner
   - **Status:** Acceptable - controlled via environment checks
