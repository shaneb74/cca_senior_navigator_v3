# Waiting Room MCIP Integration Complete

**Date:** 2024
**Branch:** feature/visual-restyling
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Testing Required

## Overview
Refactored Waiting Room hub to use MCIP-driven orchestration matching the Concierge Hub pattern. Tiles now display in priority order with gradient styling on the next recommended action.

## Changes Made

### 1. MCIP-Driven Tile Ordering

**Before:**
- Static tile order: Trivia (5) → Advisor Prep (6) → Appointment (10) → Partners (20) → etc.
- No MCIP orchestration
- No gradient styling for next recommended action

**After:**
- Dynamic MCIP-driven order: Advisor Prep (1) → Trivia (2) → Partners (3) → Appointment (10) → etc.
- Next recommended tile gets gradient styling
- Coordinated with MCIP waiting room state

### 2. Updated Functions

#### `_build_advisor_prep_tile(is_next_recommended: bool)`
- Added `is_next_recommended` parameter
- Changed `variant` from `"purple"` to `"brand"` when recommended (enables gradient)
- Changed `order` from `6` to `1` (FIRST tile in Waiting Room)
- Added `is_next_step=is_next_recommended` parameter
- Updated `recommended_total` from `3` to `5`

#### `_build_trivia_tile(is_next_recommended: bool)` *(NEW)*
- Extracted from inline tile creation
- Added MCIP orchestration support
- Changed `variant` from `"teal"` to `"brand"` when recommended
- Changed `order` from `5` to `2` (SECOND tile)
- Added `is_next_step` parameter

#### `_build_featured_partners_tile(is_next_recommended: bool)` *(NEW)*
- Extracted Featured Partners as prioritized tile
- Added MCIP orchestration support
- Set `order` to `3` (THIRD tile)
- Added `is_next_step` parameter

#### `_determine_next_recommendation()` *(NEW)*
- Implements MCIP recommendation logic
- Priority order:
  1. **Advisor Prep** - if appointment booked and not complete
  2. **Senior Trivia** - if no progress made
  3. **Featured Partners** - default recommendation
- Returns tile key string

#### `render(ctx=None)`
- Added `MCIP.initialize()` call at start
- Calls `_determine_next_recommendation()` to get next action
- Builds tiles with `is_next_recommended` flags
- Removed inline trivia tile creation (now uses `_build_trivia_tile()`)
- Filters out None tiles (Advisor Prep conditional on appointment)
- Sorts cards by `order` attribute (MCIP-driven)

### 3. Tile Order Summary

| Tile | Old Order | New Order | Conditional | MCIP Orchestrated |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Advisor Prep** | 6 | **1** | Yes (appointment booked) | ✅ Yes |
| **Senior Trivia** | 5 | **2** | No | ✅ Yes |
| **Featured Partners** | 20 | **3** | No | ✅ Yes |
| Your Appointment | 10 | 10 | No | ❌ No |
| Recommended Learning | 30 | 30 | No | ❌ No |
| While You Wait | 40 | 40 | No | ❌ No |

### 4. Gradient Styling Logic

The gradient appears when **BOTH** conditions are met:
1. `variant="brand"`
2. `is_next_step=True`

**Example Flow:**
```python
next_recommendation = _determine_next_recommendation()  # Returns "advisor_prep"

advisor_prep_tile = _build_advisor_prep_tile(
    is_next_recommended=(next_recommendation == "advisor_prep")  # True
)
# Result: variant="brand", is_next_step=True → GRADIENT APPEARS

trivia_tile = _build_trivia_tile(
    is_next_recommended=(next_recommendation == "senior_trivia")  # False
)
# Result: variant="teal", is_next_step=False → NO GRADIENT
```

## MCIP Integration Points

### Methods Used
1. **`MCIP.initialize()`** - Initializes MCIP state at hub render
2. **`MCIP.get_waiting_room_state()`** - Returns waiting room state:
   - `advisor_prep_status`: "not_started" | "in_progress" | "complete"
   - `trivia_status`: "not_started" | "in_progress" | "complete"
   - `current_focus`: "advisor_prep" | "trivia" | "learning"
3. **`MCIP.get_advisor_prep_summary()`** - Returns prep availability and progress

### Recommendation Logic
```python
def _determine_next_recommendation() -> str:
    # Priority 1: Advisor Prep (if available and incomplete)
    if advisor_prep_available and advisor_prep_progress < 100:
        return "advisor_prep"
    
    # Priority 2: Senior Trivia (if no progress)
    if trivia_progress == 0:
        return "senior_trivia"
    
    # Priority 3: Featured Partners (default)
    return "partners_spotlight"
```

## Testing Checklist

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: No Appointment Booked
- [ ] Advisor Prep tile does NOT appear
- [ ] Senior Trivia is FIRST tile with gradient (order=2 but first visible)
- [ ] Trivia has `variant="brand"` and `is_next_step=True`

#### Scenario 2: Appointment Booked, No Prep Started
- [ ] Advisor Prep appears as FIRST tile
- [ ] Advisor Prep has gradient styling (`variant="brand"`, `is_next_step=True`)
- [ ] Trivia is SECOND tile without gradient

#### Scenario 3: Advisor Prep Complete
- [ ] Advisor Prep shows "✓ All prep sections complete"
- [ ] Advisor Prep does NOT have gradient (complete)
- [ ] Senior Trivia gets gradient if no progress

#### Scenario 4: All Priorities Complete
- [ ] Advisor Prep complete (no gradient)

   - Integrate with MCIP orchestration

4. **Educational Feed Priority (Future)**
   - Consider moving Educational Feed to MCIP orchestration
   - Could be order=5 after Disease Management
   - Currently at order=30 (static)

5. **Commit and Merge**
   - Commit changes to feature/visual-restyling
   - Test thoroughly before merging to dev
   - Update documentation with screenshots

## Technical Notes

### Gradient Styling Mechanism
The gradient is applied via CSS in the ProductTileHub component when:
```python
if variant == "brand" and is_next_step:
    # Apply gradient background
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)
```

### MCIP State Persistence
- Waiting room state persists in `mcip_contracts` session state
- State includes: `advisor_prep_status`, `trivia_status`, `current_focus`
- Updates when user completes activities

### Performance Considerations
- MCIP.initialize() is idempotent (safe to call multiple times)
- Recommendation logic runs on every render (fast, no API calls)
- Tile sorting is O(n log n) where n = 6 tiles (negligible)

## Documentation Updates Needed

- [ ] Update Copilot Instructions with Waiting Room MCIP pattern
- [ ] Add screenshots of gradient styling to docs
- [ ] Document recommendation priority logic
- [ ] Update user guide with new tile ordering

## Success Criteria

✅ **Complete** when:
1. Advisor Prep appears FIRST with gradient when recommended
2. Trivia appears SECOND with gradient when recommended
3. Featured Partners appears THIRD with gradient when recommended
4. All tiles maintain proper session-safe navigation
5. Demo profiles work correctly with new ordering
6. Navi messaging coordinates with MCIP recommendations
7. No regressions in existing functionality
