# AI Advisor Chip Refresh Bug Fix

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Bug:** Suggested Question chips don't refresh after click  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## Problem Description

### Expected Behavior
Clicking a Suggested Question chip should:
1. Submit the question
2. Immediately replace the clicked chip with a new suggestion
3. Update the chip row (3-6 items) without duplicates
4. Complete within 1 second

### Actual Behavior
After clicking a chip:
- The response appears correctly
- The chip list **does not refresh** — clicked chip stays visible
- No new suggestions appear
- User has to manually refresh page to see new chips

### Repro Steps
1. Open AI Advisor (FAQs & Answers)
2. Click any Suggested Question chip
3. Observe: response appears, but chip list doesn't update

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Bug
**Index-based button keys prevented Streamlit from re-rendering chips.**

**Original code (ai_advisor.py, line 787-795):**
```python
for i, question in enumerate(suggested):
    col_idx = i % len(cols)
    with cols[col_idx]:
        if st.button(
            question,
            key=f"faq_chip_{i}",  # ❌ INDEX-BASED KEY
            use_container_width=True,
            help="Click to ask this question"
        ):
            _ask_question(question)
            st.rerun()
```

**Why this failed:**
1. Streamlit uses button `key` to track widget state
2. When `suggested` list changes, the **questions at each index change**
3. But the **keys stay the same** (`faq_chip_0`, `faq_chip_1`, etc.)
4. Streamlit sees same keys → doesn't re-render buttons → UI shows stale questions
5. State was updating correctly (exclusion list worked), but UI didn't reflect it

### The Same Bug in FAQ Page
**faq.py** had identical issue with `key=f"faq_suggested_{i}"`

---

## Solution

### Strategy
**Use unique, content-based keys + click counter**

This forces Streamlit to recognize that the widgets have changed:
1. Add `ai_chip_clicks` counter to session state
2. Increment counter on every chip click
3. Use `question_key` (or hash) + click counter in button key
4. New key = new widget instance = guaranteed re-render

### Implementation

**ai_advisor.py (lines 760-763, 786-805):**
```python
# Initialize session state
if "ai_chip_clicks" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state["ai_chip_clicks"] = 0

# ... later in render() ...

# Get suggested questions (exclude recently asked)
suggested = _get_suggested_questions(exclude=st.session_state["ai_asked_keys"])

# Render chips with unique keys based on question content + click counter
cols = st.columns(min(len(suggested), 3))
for i, question in enumerate(suggested):
    col_idx = i % len(cols)
    with cols[col_idx]:
        # Use question key (or hash) + click counter for unique button keys
        question_key = _find_question_key(question)
        unique_key = f"faq_chip_{question_key or hash(question)}_{st.session_state['ai_chip_clicks']}"
        
        if st.button(
            question,
            key=unique_key,  # ✅ UNIQUE KEY
            use_container_width=True,
            help="Click to ask this question"
        ):
            # Increment click counter to force new keys on rerun
            st.session_state["ai_chip_clicks"] += 1
            
            # Ask question and refresh chips
            _ask_question(question)
            st.rerun()
```

**faq.py (lines 473-476, 483-493):**
```python
# Initialize session state
if "ai_chip_clicks" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state["ai_chip_clicks"] = 0

# ... later in render() ...

# Get 3 dynamic questions based on user context
suggested = _get_top_3_suggestions()

# Display 3 question buttons with unique keys
cols = st.columns(3)
for i, question in enumerate(suggested):
    # Use question hash + click counter for unique keys
    unique_key = f"faq_suggested_{hash(question)}_{st.session_state['ai_chip_clicks']}"
    
    if cols[i].button(question, use_container_width=True, key=unique_key):
        # Increment click counter to force new keys on rerun
        st.session_state["ai_chip_clicks"] += 1
        _ask_question(question)
        st.rerun()
```

## How It Works

### Before Fix
```
Click 1: Questions = [Q1, Q2, Q3] with keys [chip_0, chip_1, chip_2]
  → User clicks Q1
  → _ask_question() runs, adds Q1 to exclusion list
  → st.rerun() triggers
  → Questions = [Q4, Q5, Q6] BUT keys = [chip_0, chip_1, chip_2] (unchanged)
  → Streamlit sees same keys → keeps old widgets → shows [Q1, Q2, Q3] (BUG!)
```

### After Fix
```
Click 1: Questions = [Q1, Q2, Q3] with keys [chip_start_0, chip_medicare_0, chip_next_0]
  → User clicks Q1
  → ai_chip_clicks increments from 0 to 1
  → _ask_question() runs, adds Q1 to exclusion list
  → st.rerun() triggers
  → Questions = [Q4, Q5, Q6] with keys [chip_fall_1, chip_va_1, chip_memory_1]
  → Streamlit sees NEW keys → creates NEW widgets → shows [Q4, Q5, Q6] ✅
```

## Technical Details

### Why Click Counter Works
- **Streamlit widget lifecycle:** Widget persists across reruns if key is unchanged
- **Click counter changes every interaction:** Forces Streamlit to see buttons as "new"
- **No caching issues:** Each button instance is truly unique
- **No race conditions:** Counter increments atomically before rerun

### Key Format Breakdown
```python
f"faq_chip_{question_key}_{st.session_state['ai_chip_clicks']}"
# Example: "faq_chip_start_0" → "faq_chip_fall_1" → "faq_chip_va_2"
#           ^         ^     ^
#           prefix    Q ID  click counter
```

### Advantages Over Alternatives
1. **vs. Timestamp keys:** Simpler, deterministic, no clock skew issues
2. **vs. Random keys:** Reproducible, easier to debug
3. **vs. Question text keys:** Works even if question text repeats
4. **vs. No keys:** Streamlit requires unique keys for stability

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [x] Click chip → response appears
- [x] Click chip → chip disappears from list
- [x] Click chip → new chip replaces it
- [x] Rapid clicks (5+ times) → no duplicates
- [x] No layout jump or jank
- [x] Works on desktop and mobile widths

### Edge Cases
- [x] All questions asked → pool resets correctly

   - Changed chip rendering loop with unique keys (lines 786-805)

2. **pages/faq.py**
   - Added `ai_chip_clicks` initialization (line 476)
   - Changed chip rendering loop with unique keys (lines 483-493)

## Related Issues

### Similar Bugs to Watch For
Any Streamlit button/widget in a loop needs unique keys:
- ✅ Module navigation buttons (already fixed with step-based keys)
- ✅ Product tiles (already unique IDs)
- ✅ FAQ chips (fixed in this commit)
- ✅ AI Advisor chips (fixed in this commit)

### Best Practices Going Forward
1. **Never use index-based keys for dynamic content**
2. **Always include content identifier + counter/timestamp in keys**
3. **Test chip rotation/refresh immediately after adding new chip features**
4. **Use `st.rerun()` explicitly when state changes should update UI**

---

## Deployment Notes

- **No migration needed:** Counter auto-initializes on first use
- **No data loss:** Existing sessions continue working
- **Backward compatible:** Old session state keys ignored
- **Safe to deploy:** Pure UI fix, no backend changes
