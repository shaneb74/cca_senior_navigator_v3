# Additional Services Positioning Bug Fix - FINAL

## Problem
The "Additional services" section was appearing in the wrong location (aligned to the right, outside the main container) on all hubs.

## Root Cause - Two Issues

### Issue 1: Rendering Outside Container
The hubs were rendering additional services with `st.markdown()` AFTER the main HTML was rendered, which placed them outside the `.container` div. This caused them to not have proper width constraints and padding.

### Issue 2: Mixed Rendering Paradigms  
The original fix attempted to use `st.markdown()` to render additional services separately, but this violated the container structure. The additional services need to be part of the returned HTML from `render_dashboard_body()` to be inside the proper container.

## Final Solution

**Pass `additional_services` to `render_dashboard_body()` so it gets included in the HTML shell with proper container wrapping.**

### What Changed:

1. **`core/base_hub.py`**: 
   - Builds additional services as pure HTML (no Streamlit components)
   - Includes the HTML inside the `.container` div before closing it
   - Simplified to use HTML links only (no interactive button placeholders)

2. **All hub files**:
   - Pass `additional_services` data to `render_dashboard_body()`
   - Remove separate `_render_additional_services_section()` functions
   - Let the HTML rendering handle everything

### HTML Structure (Correct):
```html
<section class="sn-hub dashboard-shell">
  <div class="container dashboard-shell__inner">
    <!-- Product tiles -->
    <div class="dashboard-grid">...</div>
    
    <!-- Additional services (INSIDE container) -->
    <section class="dashboard-additional">
      <header class="dashboard-additional__head">...</header>
      <div class="dashboard-additional__grid">
        <div class="dashboard-additional__card">...</div>
        ...
      </div>
    </section>
  </div>
</section>
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `core/base_hub.py`
**Lines 175-260**: Simplified additional services HTML building
- Removed interactive button placeholders
- Always use HTML links for CTAs
- Includes additional_html inside the container div

### 2. `hubs/concierge.py`
**Lines 95-105**: Reverted to pass `additional_services=additional`
- Removed `_render_additional_services_section()` function
- HTML rendering handles everything

### 3. `hubs/waiting_room.py`
**Lines 95-105**: Pass `additional_services=additional`
- Removed `_render_additional_services_section()` function
- Removed `import html` (no longer needed)

### 4. `hubs/learning.py`
**Lines 122-140**: Pass `additional_services=additional`
- Removed `_render_additional_services_section()` function
- Removed `import html` (no longer needed)

### 5. `hubs/trusted_partners.py`
**Lines 168-180**: Pass `additional_services=dashboard_data.get("additional_services")`
- Removed `_render_additional_services_section()` function
- Removed `import html` (no longer needed)

## Result

‚úÖ **Additional services now render INSIDE the main container**
‚úÖ **Proper width constraints applied (2-column grid)**
‚úÖ **Correct padding and spacing**
‚úÖ **Personalization labels (ü§ñ Navi Recommended) work**
‚úÖ **CSS styling applies correctly**
‚úÖ **All hubs fixed: concierge, waiting_room, learning, trusted_partners**

## Correct Page Structure:
1. Header
2. Navi panel
3. **Main container START** ‚Üê `.container .dashboard-shell__inner`
4. Product tiles
5. Additional services ‚Üê **INSIDE container now!**
6. **Main container END**
7. Footer

## Trade-off: Interactive Buttons Removed
The fix uses HTML links instead of interactive Streamlit buttons for partner connections. This ensures proper layout but removes the expand/collapse functionality. If interactive buttons are needed in the future, they would require a different approach (possibly using Streamlit's component system or custom JavaScript).

## Technical Lesson
**Always ensure Streamlit content is rendered in the right container context:**
- ‚ùå BAD: Render with `st.markdown()` after the main HTML is complete
- ‚úÖ GOOD: Build as HTML and include in the returned shell HTML
- ‚úÖ BETTER: Keep all related content in the same rendering pass
