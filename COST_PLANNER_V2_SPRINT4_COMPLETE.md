## 📊 Expert Review Features

### Executive Summary Dashboard
```
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ Monthly Cost    │ Coverage+Income │ Monthly Gap     │ Financial Runway│
│ $7,350          │ $5,200          │ -$2,150         │ 8.5 years       │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

### Gap Analysis Indicators
- **Red (>50% gap):** "Significant funding gap - schedule advisor"

### Financial Runway Logic
```python
if monthly_gap > 0 and total_assets > 0:

else:
    runway_years = 999  # Unlimited
```

### Projections with Inflation
- **1-Year:** Actual costs (no inflation)
- **3-Year:** 3% annual inflation factor
- **5-Year:** 5% total inflation factor

recommendation = MCIP.get_care_recommendation()

# Used in expert review for context display
tier_label = recommendation.tier.replace("_", " ").title()
```

### Navigation Integration
```python
from core.nav import route_to

# Route to PFMA
route_to("pfma")

# Route to Hub
route_to("hub_concierge")
```

### Session State Keys
```python
# Expert review
cost_v2_advisor_notes: str  # Optional advisor notes

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Aggregation Pattern
All three financial modules save data to `cost_v2_modules` dict with standard structure:
```python
{
    "module_key": {
        "status": "completed",
        "progress": 100,
        "data": {...}  # Module-specific data
    }
}
```

Expert review reads all three `.data` dicts and aggregates for display.

### Gap Analysis Formula
```python
monthly_gap = total_monthly_cost - total_coverage - total_monthly_income

if monthly_gap > 0:
    # Using assets to cover gap
    runway_months = total_assets / monthly_gap
else:
    # Income covers all costs
    runway_months = 999  # Unlimited
```

### Inflation Modeling
- **1-Year:** No inflation (conservative)
- **3-Year:** 3% annual = 1.03x multiplier
- **5-Year:** 5% total = 1.05x multiplier

Simple approach for user-facing estimates.
