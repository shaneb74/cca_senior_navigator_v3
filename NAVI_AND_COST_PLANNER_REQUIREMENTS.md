# Concierge Hub / Navi Panel and Cost Planner Requirements

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** Requirements Documented - Ready for Implementation

---

## 1. üß≠ Navi Panel Behavior

### Continue Button Logic
The **Continue button** beneath the Navi panel should follow Navi's recommendation for the next step:

**Priority Order:**
1. **If GCP incomplete** ‚Üí Continue opens **Guided Care Plan**
2. **If GCP complete but Cost Planner incomplete** ‚Üí Continue opens **Cost Planner**
3. **If both complete** ‚Üí Continue opens **Appointment Scheduling**

### Navi Panel Text
- ‚ùå **Remove:** Generic placeholder text like "what I know so far" or "appointment not scheduled"
- ‚úÖ **Replace with:** Context-aware next-step guidance

**Examples:**
```
"Here's what you should do next:"
‚Üí Complete your Guided Care Plan to get personalized recommendations

"Here's what you should do next:"
‚Üí Review your Cost Planner to understand care costs

"Here's what you should do next:"
‚Üí Schedule an appointment with a Care Advisor
```

### Additional Services Alert
When additional services are triggered by care or cost flags, Navi should display:

```
üí° "Hey, check out the additional services below for tailored recommendations."
```

---

## 2. üé® Additional Services Personalization

### Visual Treatment for Personalized Tiles

**Apply to tiles when:**
- Services are triggered by user-specific flags
- Navi has made a recommendation based on GCP/Cost data

**Visual Changes:**
1. **Light gradient overlay** on the tile
2. **Visible tag/label** with appropriate text

### Label Types

| Label | When to Use | Visual Style |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **"Personalized for You"** | User-specific recommendations based on profile/flags | Blue gradient, subtle glow |
| **"Navi Recommended"** | Services specifically flagged by Navi AI advisor | Green gradient, AI icon |

**Purpose:**
Visually distinguish Navi's personalized recommendations from standard options.

---

## 3. üí∞ Cost Planner - Cost of Care Adjustments Table

### Location
Include the **Cost of Care Adjustments** table in the **Cost Breakdown** section of the **Cost Recommendation** view.

### Table Content
Display each flag with:
- ‚úÖ Flag name / condition
- ‚úÖ Percentage increase
- ‚úÖ Rationale / description
- ‚úÖ **All add-ons are cumulative** (they stack)

### Reference Table

| Flag / Condition | Add-On % | Rationale / Description |
|------------------|----------|-------------------------|
| **Mobility / Transfer Issues** | +15% | `mobility_limited`, `falls_risk` ‚Äî Need lift equipment and additional staff |
| **Severe Cognitive Decline** | +20% | `memory_support`, `behavioral_concerns` ‚Äî Specialized memory care and behavior management |
| **High ADL Support** | +10% | `adl_support_high` ‚Äî Extensive help with daily activities |
| **Complex Medication** | +8% | `medication_management` ‚Äî Professional medication oversight required |
| **Chronic Conditions** | +12% | `chronic_conditions` ‚Äî Ongoing medical coordination and monitoring |
| **Safety Concerns** | +10% | `safety_concerns` ‚Äî Enhanced supervision and environmental modifications |
| **High-Acuity Memory Care** | +25% | `memory_care_high_acuity` tier ‚Äî Always applied for this tier |

### Calculation Method
```
Base Cost: $5,200/month (example)

Flag 1: Mobility Issues (+15%)  ‚Üí $5,200 √ó 1.15 = $5,980
Flag 2: High ADL Support (+10%) ‚Üí $5,980 √ó 1.10 = $6,578
Flag 3: Chronic Conditions (+12%) ‚Üí $6,578 √ó 1.12 = $7,367

Final Monthly Cost: $7,367
Total Adjustment: +41.7% from base
```

**Important:** Each add-on multiplies the running total (cumulative stacking).

   - Navi text: "Review costs"
   - Additional services show flags

3. **GCP has mobility + ADL flags**
   - Cost Planner shows +15% and +10%
   - Base $5,200 ‚Üí $6,578

4. **Both complete**
   - Continue ‚Üí Scheduling
