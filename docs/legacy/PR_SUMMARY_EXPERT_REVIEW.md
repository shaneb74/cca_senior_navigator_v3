## 🔥 Critical Bug Fixed

### Issue: Checkbox/Calculation Desync
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**User Impact:** Checking asset boxes DECREASED coverage duration (inverted behavior)

**Root Cause:**
- Base calculation used `total_liquid_assets` (included other_real_estate, life insurance)
- Checkbox calculation used `asset_categories` (narrower definition: checking, savings, investment only)
- Result: Unchecking → showed base calc (MORE assets), Checking → showed narrower calc (FEWER assets)

**Fix (Commit 4e648e8):**
- Removed fallback to `analysis.runway_months`
- Banner ALWAYS uses `extended_runway` (checkbox-based calculation)
- Changed defaults: Liquid Assets + Retirement Accounts checked
- Behavior now correct: checking = ADD assets = INCREASE duration

**Verification:**
- User confirmed: "Calculations are working correctly"
- Test scenarios documented in `CALCULATION_DIAGNOSTIC.md`

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Asset Breakdown System

**Implementation:** `expert_formulas.py` - `calculate_asset_breakdown()`

**Six Asset Categories:**
- 💵 Liquid Assets (checking, savings, investment accounts)
- 🏦 Retirement Accounts (IRA, 401k, pensions)
- 📄 Life Insurance (cash value)
- 📊 Annuities (immediate & deferred)
- 🏠 Home Equity (net after mortgage)
- 🏢 Real Estate (investment properties)

**Metadata Per Category:**
- Current Balance
- Accessible Value (net of taxes/penalties)
- Liquidity Timeframe
- Tax Implications
- Recommended Priority Order

---

### 2. Financial Summary Banner

**Location:** Top of Expert Review page  
**Replaces:** Multiple scattered metric cards

**Unified 2×2 Grid Layout:**

| **Coverage Duration** | **Estimated Care Cost** |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| 13 years, 3 months   | $13,972 per month      |
| + Assets: $1,271,000 |                        |

| **Monthly Income** | **Monthly Shortfall** |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| $6,000            | $7,972              |

**Bottom Section:**
- **Dynamic Coverage Label** (e.g., "Coverage from Income, Liquid Assets, and Retirement Accounts")
- **Progress Bar** with solid colors (#dc2626 red <50%, #f59e0b amber 50-80%, #16a34a green 80%+)
- Shows income coverage percentage (43% in Mary's case)

**Debt Display (when applicable):**
- Gross Assets → Less: Debts → Net Available Assets
- Amber card with clear breakdown

---

### 3. Dynamic Coverage Label

**Function:** `_get_dynamic_coverage_label(selected_assets, asset_categories)`

**Examples:**
- No assets: *"Coverage from Income"*
- Liquid only: *"Coverage from Income and Liquid Assets"*
- Liquid + Retirement: *"Coverage from Income, Liquid Assets, and Retirement Accounts"*
- Scales automatically to future asset types

**UI Integration:**
- Updates instantly when checkboxes toggled
- No flicker or delay
- Grammatically correct with proper Oxford comma

---

### 4. Context-Aware Navi Messaging

**Dynamic Logic Based On:**
1. Income coverage percentage
2. Selected assets and resulting duration
3. Coverage adequacy tier

**Message Examples:**

| Scenario | Navi Message |
|----------|-------------|
| Income ≥90% or duration >10y | *"You're in great shape! Your care plan is sustainable long-term."* |
| Income 50-89%, assets added | *"Good progress! Adding assets extends your coverage significantly."* |
| Income 50-89%, no assets | *"Strong foundation. Consider adding liquid assets or retirement funds to close your coverage gap."* |
| Income <50%, no assets | *"Your income doesn't fully cover your care costs. Add your liquid assets or retirement accounts to strengthen your plan."* |
| Income <50%, duration ≥5y | *"Excellent progress! Your combined resources create a sustainable plan."* |

**Transitions:**
- Updates in real-time as user toggles checkboxes
- Acknowledges progress as coverage improves
- Provides actionable guidance when coverage inadequate

---

### 5. Available Resources Section

**Expandable Cards per Category:**
- Balance summary in header
- Availability status badge (Ready Now / Taxed as Income / 1-3 Months / etc.)
- Checkbox to include in care funding plan
- Detailed metadata (tax implications, accessibility timeline)

**Interactive Behavior:**
- Default: Liquid Assets + Retirement Accounts checked
- Toggle checkbox → `st.rerun()` → recalculate → update banner & Navi
- Selected assets summary: "2 resources selected — contributing $1,271,000 toward care"

---

## 📊 User Experience Flow

### Example: Mary (43% income coverage, $1.27M assets)

**Step 1: Initial Load**
```
Coverage Duration: 13 years, 3 months
Label: "Coverage from Income, Liquid Assets, and Retirement Accounts"
Navi: "Excellent progress! Your combined resources create a sustainable plan."
```

**Step 2: Uncheck Retirement Accounts**
```
Coverage Duration: 9 years, 9 months
Label: "Coverage from Income and Liquid Assets"
Navi: "You're building a stronger plan. Consider additional resources to extend coverage further."
```

**Step 3: Uncheck Liquid Assets**
```
Coverage Duration: 0 months (income only)
Label: "Coverage from Income"
Navi: "Your income doesn't fully cover your care costs. Add your liquid assets or retirement accounts to strengthen your plan."
```

**Step 4: Recheck Both**
```
Back to Step 1 - Smooth transition, no flicker
```
