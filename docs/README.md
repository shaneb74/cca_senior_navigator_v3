# Documentation Map

## Canonical Documentation (Indexed)

These are the source-of-truth docs for developers and AI coding agents:

- **REPO_STRUCTURE.md** - High-level repository organization
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System architecture and design decisions  
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Development guidelines and workflows
- **VERIFICATION_REPORT.md** (root) - Current repo health status

## Legacy / Session Notes (Ignored by Copilot)

Historical development notes, fix logs, and session documentation:

- **docs/legacy/** - Ad-hoc session notes, implementation logs, fix documentation
  - Ignored by Copilot via `.copilotignore`
  - Excluded from VS Code search via `.vscode/settings.json`
  - Preserved for historical reference but not indexed for coding context

These files document specific fixes and development sessions but are not needed for ongoing development context.
