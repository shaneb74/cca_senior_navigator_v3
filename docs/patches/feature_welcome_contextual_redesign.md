# üé® Feature: Welcome Contextual Page Redesign  
**Branch:** `feature/welcome_contextual_redesign`  
**Goal:** Refresh the contextual welcome page (the ‚ÄúFor someone / For me‚Äù flow) to match the modern Senior Navigator aesthetic while retaining all original logic for context and relationship selection.

---

## üé® Style Intent ‚Äî Design System Alignment

**Overall Goal:**  
Make the contextual welcome experience feel like part of a modern, mobile-first app ‚Äî lightweight, soft-edged, intuitive, and fully aligned with the Senior Navigator design system.

| Element | Intent |
|----------|--------|
| **Buttons** | Rounded ‚Äúpill‚Äù shape, soft shadows, minimal borders |
| **Color Scheme** | Neutral base (`#f2f4f8`), highlight (`#4f46e5` for active state), hover tint (`#e4e8ff`) |
| **Typography** | Clean sans-serif (Inter / system-ui), weight 500‚Äì600 for headings, 400 for body |
| **Animation** | Subtle (‚â§0.25s) transitions on hover and focus |
| **Layout** | Responsive flex; horizontal on desktop, stacked on mobile |
| **Tone** | Warm, supportive, and app-like (no corporate stiffness or Streamlit blockiness) |

All future contextual entry points (Concierge Hub, Learning Center, Cost Planner, etc.) should inherit these visual rules for coherence.

---

## üß≠ Purpose
The current welcome page still uses default Streamlit button styling, which looks more like a developer dashboard than a consumer app.  
This patch introduces lightweight HTML/CSS wrappers to achieve a polished, pill-style interface while keeping all session logic, relationship dropdowns, and event handling fully intact.

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

### Functional
- Maintain existing `session_state` logic for:
  - `context` (`for_someone`, `for_me`)
  - `relationship` (dropdown or modal)
- Maintain full logical flow:
  - Selecting ‚ÄúFor someone‚Äù opens the relationship picker.
  - Selecting ‚ÄúFor me‚Äù bypasses it.
- No new dependencies or frameworks.

### Visual
- Replace Streamlit buttons with pill-style toggle buttons.
- Add smooth hover, focus, and active states.
- Auto-stack vertically below 768 px.
- Preserve accessibility and keyboard navigation.

---

## üß© Implementation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ HTML/Python (`welcome.py`)

```python
# Context & relationship logic preserved
context = st.session_state.get("context", None)
relationship = st.session_state.get("relationship", None)

st.markdown("""
<div class="context-toggle-container">
  <button class="context-toggle {active_someone}" onclick="set_context('someone')">
    üë• For someone
  </button>
  <button class="context-toggle {active_me}" onclick="set_context('me')">
    üôÇ For me
  </button>
</div>
""".format(
    active_someone="active" if context == "someone" else "",
    active_me="active" if context == "me" else "",
), unsafe_allow_html=True)

# Relationship picker (unchanged)
if context == "someone":
    st.selectbox(
        "What is your relationship to this person?",
        ["Parent", "Spouse", "Sibling", "Friend", "Client", "Other"],
        key="relationship",
    )
````

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ CSS (`assets/css/overrides.css`)

```css
/* === Contextual Welcome Redesign === */
.context-toggle-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  gap: 1rem;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  margin: 1rem 0 2rem;
}

.context-toggle {
  border: none;
  border-radius: 999px;
  padding: 0.6rem 1.5rem;
  background: #f2f4f8;
  color: #222;
  font-weight: 600;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: all 0.25s ease;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);
}

.context-toggle:hover {
  background: #e4e8ff;
}

.context-toggle.active {
  background: #4f46e5;
  color: white;
  box-shadow: 0 3px 8px rgba(79, 70, 229, 0.3);
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .context-toggle-container {
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
  }
}
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Commit Message

```

- Add mobile responsive flex layout and soft transitions
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Notes for Claude / Implementation Agent

* **Do not modify logic** ‚Äî all state handling remains in `st.session_state`.
* Only adjust **HTML + CSS presentation**.
* Ensure buttons remain clickable with consistent routing.
* Apply the same visual system for any future contextual entry points (Concierge Hub, Learning Center).
* No pixel locking ‚Äî fluid responsiveness is preferred.

---

### ‚úÖ Expected Outcome

* ‚ÄúFor someone / For me‚Äù toggles display as smooth, rounded pills with active states.
* Relationship dropdown appears naturally when required.
* Layout looks intentional, modern, and responsive.
* The overall tone matches the rest of the modernized interface.

This version is **finalized and self-contained** ‚Äî all decisions, visual intent, logic retention, and implementation instructions are baked in.  
No more follow-up docs needed; this one can be handed off directly to Claude or committed straight into your `feature/post_css` branch.
