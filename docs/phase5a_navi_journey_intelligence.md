## üß± System Behavior Overview

### 1. **Journey Phases**
| Phase | Description | Example Tiles |
|:------|:-------------|:--------------|
| `discovery` | User orientation, introduction to NAVI and goals | Discovery Learning, Learn About My Recommendation |
| `planning` | Active decision-making and assessment | Guided Care Plan, Cost Planner, My Advisor |
| `postplanning` | Reflection, follow-up, engagement | Concierge Clinical Review, Additional Services |

`core/journeys.py` additions:
```python
def get_phase_completion(phase: str) -> float:
    """Return percentage of completion within a given journey phase."""
    completed = [p for p in st.session_state.get("completed_tiles", []) if p["phase"] == phase]
    total = [p for p in st.session_state.get("registered_tiles", []) if p["phase"] == phase]
    return len(completed) / len(total) if total else 0.0
````

---

### 2. **Phase Pills (Visual Tags)**

Each product tile displays a small phase label for clarity.

```css
/* ----- JOURNEY PHASE PILLS ----- */
.phase-pill {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0.8rem;
  right: 0.8rem;
  font-size: 0.7rem;
  font-weight: 600;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 0.25rem 0.7rem;
  border-radius: 9999px;
  letter-spacing: 0.03em;
}
.phase-pill.discovery { background-color: #5BA3FF; }
.phase-pill.planning { background-color: #4BBE83; }
.phase-pill.postplanning { background-color: #B974E4; }
```

Example for a Planning tile:

```python
st.markdown('<div class="phase-pill planning">PLANNING</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

---

### 3. **Discovery Learning Tile**

**Purpose:** Introduce NAVI, explain what to expect, and help the user orient themselves.

`product_discovery_learning.py` outline:

```python
import streamlit as st
from core.journeys import advance_to

def render():
    st.title("Start Your Discovery Journey")
    st.markdown("### Welcome to Senior Navigator!")
    st.markdown("> üëã Hi, I‚Äôm NAVI. Let‚Äôs take a quick look at what you can do here.")
    
    st.info("Together, we‚Äôll explore your situation, understand your care options, and help you plan confidently.")

    if st.button("Continue to Guided Care Plan"):
        advance_to("planning")
        st.switch_page("pages/product_guided_care_plan.py")
```

---

### 4. **NAVI Context Enhancements**

NAVI now adjusts tone and progress scope dynamically:

| Phase        | Tone                        | Example Message                                                 |
| :----------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Discovery    | Encouraging / welcoming     | ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just getting started ‚Äî let‚Äôs explore together.‚Äù         |
| Planning     | Confident / helpful         | ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre halfway through your planning journey ‚Äî nice progress!‚Äù |
| Postplanning | Supportive / future-focused | ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve completed your planning! Let‚Äôs see what comes next.‚Äù    |

In `guidance_manager.py`, add:

```python
def get_phase_tone():
    phase = st.session_state.get("journey_stage", "discovery")
    return {
        "discovery": "encouraging",
        "planning": "helpful",
        "postplanning": "supportive"
    }.get(phase, "neutral")
```

### 5. **Learn About My Recommendation Enhancements**

Expand to include more NAVI-led education and transitions:

* Additional empathy dialogue.
* Resource linking (VA, Alzheimer‚Äôs, etc.).
* Optional ‚ÄúTell Me More‚Äù button that triggers secondary NAVI explanation.
