# Aggregate & VA Benefits Immediate Refresh Fix

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Branch:** `feature/calculation-verification`  
**Issue:** Aggregate totals and VA disability payment don't update immediately after field changes  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## Problem Summary

### Original Issue
When users edited contributing fields in the Assets & Resources or VA Benefits assessments, aggregate totals and calculated displays did not refresh immediately. A second interaction (click, tab, scroll) was required to see the updated values.

### User Impact
- **Assets Assessment:** Editing "Checking" didn't update "Checking & Savings (Total)" until clicking elsewhere
- **VA Benefits:** Changing "Dependents Status" didn't update "Monthly VA Disability Payment" until second interaction
- Created confusion and doubt about whether edits were saved
- Made users perform unnecessary extra clicks

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Aggregate Fields Reading Wrong Data Source

**Problem:**
- Aggregate fields (e.g., `cash_liquid_total`) rendered BEFORE their sub-fields in the field order
- When aggregate rendered, it read from `new_values` dict which only contained fields already rendered
- Sub-fields hadn't rendered yet, so their updated values weren't in `new_values`

**Example Flow (BEFORE FIX):**
```python
# Render pass:
1. Render cash_liquid_total (aggregate)
   - Reads new_values.get("checking_balance") → None (not rendered yet)
   - Reads state.get("checking_balance") → old value from previous save
   - Shows stale total

2. Render checking_balance widget
   - User sees updated value in input
   - Value stored in st.session_state["field_checking_balance"]
   - Not yet in new_values or state dict

Result: Aggregate shows old total, input shows new value → confusion!
```

### Issue 2: Number Input Doesn't Auto-Trigger Rerun

**Problem:**
- Streamlit's `st.number_input` updates `st.session_state` when value changes
- BUT it doesn't automatically trigger a rerun on blur (leaving the field)
- Only triggers rerun if user presses Enter or something else causes rerun

**Example:**
```python
# User edits checking from $10,000 to $20,000 and tabs out:
1. Widget updates st.session_state["field_checking_balance"] = 20000
2. No rerun triggered
3. Aggregate still shows old calculation
4. User clicks somewhere else → rerun → aggregate updates

Result: Need 2 interactions instead of 1
```

### Issue 3: VA Benefits Reading Persisted State Instead of Widget State

**Problem:**
- VA disability auto-calculation ran BEFORE widgets rendered
- Read values from `state.get("va_dependents")` (persisted data from previous save)
- Ignored `st.session_state["field_va_dependents"]` (current widget value)

**Example Flow (BEFORE FIX):**
```python
# User changes Dependents from "none" to "spouse":
1. Dropdown updates st.session_state["field_va_dependents"] = "spouse"
2. VA calculation logic runs
3. Reads state.get("va_dependents") → "none" (old persisted value)
4. Calculates disability payment for "none" → shows wrong amount
5. User clicks elsewhere → rerun → finally sees correct calculation

Result: Always one render pass behind
```

## Solution Implemented

### Fix 1: Read From Widget Session State Directly

**Change:** Aggregate fields now read from `st.session_state` using widget key pattern instead of `new_values` dict.

**Code Change (assessment_engine.py):**
```python
# BEFORE:
elif field_type == "display_currency_aggregate":
    for sub_field_key in sub_fields:
        sub_value = new_values.get(sub_field_key)  # Only has already-rendered fields
        if sub_value is None:
            sub_value = state.get(sub_field_key)  # Old persisted value

# AFTER:
elif field_type == "display_currency_aggregate":
    for sub_field_key in sub_fields:
        widget_key = f"field_{sub_field_key}"
        # Read from widget session state FIRST (current value), then fall back
        sub_value = st.session_state.get(widget_key, state.get(sub_field_key))
```

**Result:**
- Aggregate always sees current widget values
- No longer depends on render order
- Shows real-time calculation

### Fix 2: Add on_change Callback to Trigger Rerun

**Change:** Added `on_change=lambda: None` to `st.number_input` widgets to force immediate rerun on blur.

**Code Change (assessment_engine.py):**
```python
# Currency fields:
value = container.number_input(
    label=label,
    # ... other params ...
    key=widget_key,
    on_change=lambda: None,  # NEW: Triggers rerun when field loses focus
)

# Aggregate fields (basic mode):
value = container.number_input(
    label=label,
    # ... other params ...
    key=widget_key,
    on_change=lambda: None,  # NEW: Triggers rerun when field loses focus
)
```

**Why `lambda: None`?**
- Streamlit's `on_change` callback fires when widget value changes AND field loses focus (blur)
- We don't need to do anything in the callback - just triggering a rerun is enough
- Empty lambda is simplest way to achieve this

**Result:**
- Editing a field and tabbing/clicking out triggers immediate rerun
- No second interaction needed

### Fix 3: VA Benefits Read Widget State Before Calculation

**Change:** VA disability auto-calculation now reads from widget session state instead of persisted state, and clears values when user changes from "Yes" to "No".

**Code Change (assessments.py):**
```python
# BEFORE:
if assessment_key == "va_benefits" and section.get("id") == "va_disability":
    has_disability = state.get("has_va_disability") == "yes"
    rating = state.get("va_disability_rating")
    dependents = state.get("va_dependents")

# AFTER:
if assessment_key == "va_benefits" and section.get("id") == "va_disability":
    # Read from widget session state keys (current render) not state dict (previous render)
    widget_has_disability = st.session_state.get("field_has_va_disability", state.get("has_va_disability"))
    widget_rating = st.session_state.get("field_va_disability_rating", state.get("va_disability_rating"))
    widget_dependents = st.session_state.get("field_va_dependents", state.get("va_dependents"))
    
    has_disability = widget_has_disability == "yes"
    rating = widget_rating
    dependents = widget_dependents
    
    # NEW: If user changes "Yes" to "No", clear all VA disability values
    if not has_disability:
        state["va_disability_rating"] = None
        state["va_dependents"] = None
        state["va_disability_monthly"] = 0.0
        # Clear widget session state and tracking variables
        st.rerun()
```

**Result:**
- VA disability calculation uses current dropdown values
- Monthly payment updates immediately when dependents change
- **When user changes "Yes" to "No", all VA disability values reset to zero**
- No lag in calculation

## Technical Details

### Streamlit Widget Session State Pattern

**How Streamlit Widgets Work:**
```python
# When you create a widget with a key:
value = st.number_input("Amount", key="field_amount", value=100)

# Streamlit automatically:
1. Stores current value in st.session_state["field_amount"]
2. Updates this value IMMEDIATELY when widget changes
3. Returns the current value

# Widget value is always in session state, even before form submission
```

**Widget Key Pattern:**
```python
# Assessment engine uses consistent pattern:
widget_key = f"field_{field_key}"

# Example:
field_key = "checking_balance"
widget_key = "field_checking_balance"  # Session state key

# To read current value:
current_value = st.session_state.get("field_checking_balance", default)
```

### on_change Callback Behavior

**When on_change Fires:**
- User changes widget value AND widget loses focus (blur)
- Triggers before next render pass
- Causes immediate rerun if callback exists (even empty)

**Why This Works:**
```python
# Before:
number_input(key="field_x")  
# → User edits and tabs out → value updates in session state → no rerun

# After:
number_input(key="field_x", on_change=lambda: None)
# → User edits and tabs out → value updates → on_change fires → immediate rerun

# Result: Display refreshes immediately showing new calculation
```

### Reading Order Priority

**Best Practice for Reading Widget Values:**
```python
# 1. Try widget session state (most current)
widget_value = st.session_state.get(f"field_{key}")

# 2. Fall back to persisted state (previous save)
if widget_value is None:
    widget_value = state.get(key)

# 3. Fall back to default
if widget_value is None:
    widget_value = field.get("default", 0)
```

## Pattern for Future Fields

### Adding Calculated Display Fields

When adding new aggregate or calculated display fields:

**1. Use display_currency_aggregate field type:**
```json
{
  "key": "new_total",
  "label": "New Total",
  "type": "display_currency_aggregate",
  "aggregate_from": ["field1", "field2", "field3"]
}
```

**2. Read from widget session state in calculations:**
```python
# Read current widget value (not persisted state)
widget_value = st.session_state.get(f"field_{key}", state.get(key))
```

**3. Add on_change to contributing fields:**
```python
# If contributing fields are currency inputs, they already have on_change
# If custom logic, ensure on_change callback triggers rerun
st.selectbox(..., on_change=lambda: None)
```

**That's it!** The aggregate will update immediately when any contributing field changes.
