## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### **1. Navi Announces Recommendation**

**File:** `core/modules/engine.py` → `_render_results_view()`

```python
# Import Navi panel renderer
from core.ui import render_navi_panel_v2

# Build Navi guidance with recommendation
navi_title = "Great job! Based on your answers, here's what I recommend:"
navi_description = rec_text  # "No Care Needed", "In-Home Care", etc.

# Add reassurance message
navi_support = "Your care plan can evolve as your needs change. You can retake this assessment anytime to get an updated recommendation."

render_navi_panel_v2(
    variant="module",
    title=navi_title,
    description=navi_description,
    support=navi_support,
    chips=None,
    actions=None
)
```

**Visual Impact:**
- Recommendation comes from Navi's voice (not a separate hero card)
- Reassurance message integrated into Navi support text
- Consistent with all other Navi appearances in modules

### **2. Recommendation Clarity → Collapsible Drawer**

**Purpose:** Developer tool for fine-tuning scoring algorithms

```python
with st.expander("🔧 Recommendation Clarity (For Fine-Tuning)", expanded=False):
    st.markdown(f"""
    <div style="...white card...">
        <div style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600; color: {clarity_color};">
            {boundary_clarity}%
        </div>
        <div style="font-size: 14px; color: #64748b;">
            {clarity_message}
        </div>
        <!-- Progress bar -->
        <div style="font-size: 13px; color: #64748b;">
            <strong>Score:</strong> {tier_score} points<br/>
            <strong>Tier:</strong> {tier.replace('_', ' ').title()}<br/>
            <strong>Range:</strong> {min_score}-{max_score} points
        </div>
    </div>
    """, unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

**Visual Impact:**
- Hidden by default (collapsed drawer)
- Technical scoring data available for developers
- Doesn't clutter main user experience

### **3. Question Completeness - White Card**

**Styled consistently with module redesign theme:**

```python
st.markdown(f"""
<div style="
    background: white;
    border: 1px solid #e2e8f0;
    border-radius: 12px;
    padding: 24px;
    margin-bottom: 32px;
">
    <div style="font-size: 12px; color: #64748b; font-weight: 600; letter-spacing: 0.5px; margin-bottom: 12px;">
        QUESTION COMPLETENESS
    </div>
    <div style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: 600; color: {completeness_color}; margin-bottom: 8px;">
        {completeness_pct}%
    </div>
    <div style="font-size: 14px; color: #64748b; margin-bottom: 16px;">
        {answered_count} of {total_count} questions answered
    </div>
    <!-- Progress bar with blue fill -->
</div>
""", unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

**Color Logic:**
- `#22c55e` (green) if ≥ 90%
- `#f59e0b` (amber) if ≥ 70%
- `#3b82f6` (blue) otherwise ← **Changed from red to blue** for less alarm

### **4. Removed Elements**

✅ **Removed Blue Gradient Hero Card:**
```python
# OLD: Blue gradient with confidence badge
<div class="gcp-rec-card" style="
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #eff6ff 0%, #f0f9ff 100%);
    ...
    Confidence: 33% • Building 🔴
">
```
**Why:** Recommendation now comes from Navi, not a separate card.

✅ **Removed Yellow Warning Banner:**
```python
# OLD: Yellow bar with reassurance message
<div class="gcp-reassure" style="
    background: #fff8e1;
    border: 1px solid #fde68a;
    ...
">
    💬 Your care plan can evolve...
</div>
```
**Why:** Message now in Navi support text.

✅ **Removed Confidence Badges:**
- No more green/amber/red traffic light colors
- No more "Strong • Moderate • Building" labels
- Technical confidence data moved to Clarity drawer

✅ **Removed "What Happens Next" Section:**
```python
# OLD: Big paragraph about Cost Planner
<div class="gcp-next">
    <div class="gcp-next__title">What Happens Next</div>
    <p>Now that you have a recommendation, the next step is...</p>
</div>
```
**Why:** Unnecessary pre-button text. Buttons speak for themselves.

✅ **Removed Duplicate Calculate Costs Button:**
- Old layout had 3 buttons: Calculate, Review, Back
- New layout has 2 buttons: Review, Back
- Cost Planner accessible from Hub (no forced flow)

---

## 🎨 Design Principles Applied

### **1. Navi is the Primary Communicator**
**Before:** Multiple colored cards competing for attention  
**After:** Navi speaks directly to user with recommendation

**User Benefit:**
- Single, trusted voice (Navi)
- Less cognitive load
- Feels like guided conversation

### **2. Important vs. Technical Information**
**Important (User-Facing):**
- ✅ Recommendation (from Navi)
- ✅ Reassurance message (from Navi)
- ✅ Question completeness (main view, white card)
- ✅ Why you got this recommendation (bullet list)

**Technical (Developer/Fine-Tuning):**
- 🔧 Recommendation clarity (collapsible drawer)
- 🔧 Score, tier, range (hidden by default)

**User Benefit:**
- Clean, focused experience
- Technical details available but not intrusive

### **3. Consistent Visual Language**
**Before:** Blue gradients, yellow warnings, green/amber/red badges  
**After:** White cards, blue accents, subtle gray text

**Matches:**
- ✅ Hub tiles (white cards, shadows)
- ✅ Module form fields (white cards, 16px border-radius)
- ✅ Navi panel (blue accent, clean typography)

**User Benefit:**
- Visually consistent throughout app
- Professional, polished appearance
- Less overwhelming

### **4. Simplified Navigation**
**Before:** 3-4 buttons with unclear hierarchy  
**After:** 2 clear actions (Review Answers + Back to Hub)

**User Benefit:**
- Clear decision points
- No forced flow to Cost Planner
- Easy to review or exit

## 🔄 User Flow Comparison

### **Before:**

## 💡 Design Rationale

### **Problem Solved:**
**User Feedback:** *"Yes, but this page is a disaster still. We need to incorporate YOUR CARE RECOMMENDATION into Navi. She is saying it now. Get rid of all the wild colors. The Recommended Clarity can go into a drawer... I don't want it in the main view. The yellow bar - that's a great thing for Navi to say. Basically, anything we want to communicate to the user, Navi says it, and only if it is important."*

### **Solution Applied:**

1. **Navi as Primary Communicator:**
   - Moved recommendation into Navi panel
   - Moved reassurance message into Navi support
   - User hears from one trusted voice

2. **Color Cleanup:**
   - Removed blue gradient card
   - Removed yellow warning banner
   - Removed green/amber/red confidence badges
   - Used blue for progress (positive, not alarming)

3. **Information Hierarchy:**
   - Important = Visible (Navi, Completeness, Why)
   - Technical = Hidden (Clarity drawer for developers)
   - User sees what matters, devs see what they need

4. **Simplified Navigation:**
   - 2 buttons instead of 3-4
   - No forced flow to next step
   - Clear, user-controlled choices

| **Button Count** | 3 | 2 | -33% |
| **Visual Clutter** | High (competing cards) | Low (single flow) | Significant reduction |
