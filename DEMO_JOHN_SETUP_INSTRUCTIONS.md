## Troubleshooting

### "File already exists" error
The file was created by the app but is empty. Stop the app first, then run the script.

### "Operation not permitted" error
The Streamlit app has a file lock. You must stop the app before running the script.

### Data doesn't persist after restart
Check `core/session_store.py` - ensure these keys are in `USER_PERSIST_KEYS`:
- `gcp_care_recommendation`
- `gcp_v4_published`
- `gcp_v4_complete`
- All `cost_v2_*` keys

### GCP shows as incomplete
Verify the `tiles` section in the JSON has:
```json
"gcp_v4": {
  "status": "completed",
  "progress": 100.0,
  "saved_state": { ... all answers ... }
}
```

## File Structure

The demo user data is stored at:
```
data/users/demo_john_cost_planner.json
```

This file contains:
- Profile information (name, age, location, zip)
- Progress tracking (completed products)
- GCP assessment answers (`gcp_care_recommendation`)
- GCP care recommendation result (`mcip_contracts.care_recommendation`)
- Cost Planner module data (`cost_v2_modules`)
- Cost Planner quick estimate (`cost_v2_quick_estimate`)
- Tile states (`tiles`, `product_tiles_v2`)
- Journey tracking (`mcip_contracts.journey`)
