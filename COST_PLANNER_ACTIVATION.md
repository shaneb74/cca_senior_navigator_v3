## ✅ What's Been Implemented

The Cost Planner now implements the **complete flow** as depicted in `COST_PLANNER_ROUTING_VISUAL.md`:

### Flow Diagram (Implemented)

```
GCP Complete (100%)
  ↓
Hub Tile OR GCP Summary CTA ← Both paths work now!
  ↓
Cost Planner Intro (gate bypassed ✅)
  ↓
Quick Estimate ("Plan for Your Care Recommendation")
  - Purple box: Shows GCP recommendation
  - Care type selector (5 options, GCP rec pre-selected)
  - "See My Estimate" button
  ↓
Click "See My Estimate"
  - Cost breakdown appears
  - Button changes to "Continue to Full Assessment"
  ↓
Click "Continue to Full Assessment"
  - Auth check: authenticated? → Profile Flags : Auth Gate
  ↓
Auth Gate (if not authenticated)
  - "🔒 Authentication Required"
  - Mock Login button
  - After login → Profile Flags
  ↓
Profile Flags
  - ZIP code (required)
  - Veteran status (required)
  - Home ownership (required)
  - Medicaid status (required)
  ↓
Module Index
  - 6 modules with conditional visibility
  - Housing (if home_owner AND NOT In-Home Care)
  - Income (always)
  - Assets (always)
  - VA Benefits (if veteran)
  - Health Insurance (always)
  - Medicaid Navigator (if medicaid)
```

## 🔧 Key Fixes

### 1. GCP Gate Consistency Fix (AC1 + AC2)

**Problem:** Hub tile used `gcp_progress >= 100` check, but Cost Planner product used `handoff["gcp"]["recommendation"]` check

**Result:** Hub unlocked tile, but Cost Planner still showed "GCP Required" gate

**Solution:**
```python
# OLD (broken)
gcp_rec = handoff["gcp"]["recommendation"]
if not gcp_rec:
    # Show gate

# NEW (fixed)
gcp_progress = float(st.session_state.get("gcp", {}).get("progress", 0))
if gcp_progress < 100:
    # Show gate
```

**File:** `products/cost_planner/product.py` lines 39-42

### 2. Complete Flow Implementation (AC3-5)

All steps configured and rendering correctly:
- ✅ Step 0: Intro
- ✅ Step 1: Quick Estimate (custom rendering)
- ✅ Step 2: Auth Gate (conditional)
- ✅ Step 3: Profile Flags
- ✅ Step 4: Module Index (conditional visibility)

## 🧪 Quick Test (5 minutes)

**Fastest way to verify everything works:**

1. Navigate to http://localhost:8501
2. Complete GCP (Guided Care Plan) to Summary
3. **Test Path A:** Back to Hub → Click Cost Planner tile
   - ✅ **Should NOT see "GCP Required" gate**
   - ✅ **Should see Cost Planner Intro**
4. Click Continue → See "Plan for Your Care Recommendation"
5. Click "See My Estimate" → Costs appear, button changes
6. Click "Continue to Full Assessment" → See Auth Gate
7. Click "🔓 Sign In (Dev)" → Skip to Profile Flags
8. Fill all 4 fields → Continue → See Module Index
9. **Verify:** All 6 modules visible with correct status

**Expected Time:** ~5 minutes

✅ GCP Summary CTA works (Path B)  
✅ Quick Estimate shows GCP recommendation  
✅ "See My Estimate" reveals costs  
✅ Button changes to "Continue to Full Assessment"  
✅ Auth gate blocks and allows mock login  
✅ Profile flags all required  
✅ Module Index shows 6 modules  
✅ Module visibility based on flags works
