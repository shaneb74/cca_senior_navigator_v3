"""Journey phase detection helper.

Determines the current journey phase (discovery, planning, post-planning) based
on user state and MCIP completion flags.

Used by hub_lobby.py to determine which tiles appear active, locked, or completed.

Phase 5A enhancements:
- get_phase_completion() for phase-based progress tracking
- advance_to() for explicit phase transitions
- get_current_journey() for session-based phase reading
