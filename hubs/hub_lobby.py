"""
Lobby Hub - Unified Dashboard Entry Point

Phase 4A: Consolidated Waiting Room and Lobby into single adaptive hub.
Manages the entire user journey lifecycle: Discovery → Planning → Post-Planning.

Phase 5E: Dynamic Personalization integration.
Personalized navigation, tone, and visible modules based on user tier, cognition, and phase.

Architecture:
--------------
- Dynamic product tile rendering via ProductTileHub objects
- MCIP-based journey phase detection and product gating
- Organized tile categories: Discovery, Planning, Engagement, Additional Services, Completed
- NAVI-integrated FAQ (no longer a tile)
- Phase 5E: Schema-driven personalization via core.personalizer

Phase History:
--------------
Phase 3A: NAVI integration, MCIP gating, Additional Services
Phase 3B: Personalized NAVI, product outcomes, FAQ always unlocked
Phase 4A: Waiting Room consolidation, completed journeys, FAQ→NAVI integration
Phase 5D: Journey alignment, navigation fixes, 4-section structure
Phase 5E: Dynamic personalization engine integration
