## Known Issues / Lint Warnings

### Non-Critical (Pre-existing)
- Import warnings in hub_lobby.py (ui.header_simple, ui.footer_simple) - modules exist, lint issue only
- JSON boolean warnings in nav.json - cosmetic, does not affect functionality
- Type hint warnings in app.py, layout.py - pre-existing, not introduced by Phase 4A

### Critical Issues
- **None identified** - All functionality implemented and testable

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback is simple:

```bash
# Option 1: Reset branch to before Phase 4A
git checkout feature/waiting-room-consolidation
git reset --hard 6026e99  # Before Phase 4A implementation

# Option 2: Revert specific commits
git revert 877b005..674943f

# Option 3: Delete branch and stay on main
git checkout main
git branch -D feature/waiting-room-consolidation
```

**Note:** No database migrations or persistence changes were made. Rollback is safe and immediate.

---

## Next Steps

### Before Merge to Main
1. **Manual Testing**: Complete all checklist items above
2. **Visual QA**: Verify Lobby layout and tile organization
3. **Flow Testing**: Test full user journey (GCP → Cost → Engagement)
4. **Route Verification**: Test all "Return to Lobby" buttons
5. **NAVI Integration**: Verify "Ask NAVI" button works

### After Testing Passes
1. Create PR: `feature/waiting-room-consolidation` → `main`
2. Review MERGE_CHECKLIST.md items
3. Squash commits if desired (keep clean history)
4. Merge to main
5. Delete feature branch
6. Tag release (e.g., `v4.0.0-phase4a`)

### Post-Merge
1. Monitor for navigation issues
2. Verify no broken routes in production
3. Check analytics for "Ask NAVI" usage
4. Gather user feedback on unified hub
