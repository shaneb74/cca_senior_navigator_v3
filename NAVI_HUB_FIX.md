# Navi Hub Integration Fix

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Branch:** `feature/cost_planner_v2`  
**Commit:** 7ece281

## Problem

Hub pages were crashing with `ValueError` after Navi integration (commit 451326a):

```
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)

File "core/ui.py", line 792, in render_navi_panel_v2
    col1, col2 = st.columns([2, 1] if secondary_action else [1])
```

## Root Cause

The `render_navi_panel_v2()` function in `core/ui.py` had a logic error in button rendering:

```python
# BEFORE (broken):
col1, col2 = st.columns([2, 1] if secondary_action else [1])
# When secondary_action is None, st.columns([1]) returns 1 column
# But code tries to unpack into 2 variables → ValueError
```

This affected all hubs where Navi didn't have a secondary action (most hubs).

## Solution

Refactored the button rendering logic to handle both cases separately:

```python
# AFTER (fixed):
if secondary_action:
    # Two-button layout (2:1 ratio)
    col1, col2 = st.columns([2, 1])
    with col1:
        # Primary button
        ...
    with col2:
        # Secondary button
        ...
else:
    # Single-button layout (full width)
    # Primary button
    ...
```

## Files Changed

**`core/ui.py` (lines 787-827)**
- Split button rendering into conditional branches
- Primary button renders in col1 when secondary present
- Primary button renders full-width when secondary absent
- Secondary button only renders when present

## Testing

### Before Fix
- ❌ All hub pages crashed on load
- ❌ `ValueError: not enough values to unpack`
- ❌ No hubs accessible

### After Fix
- ✅ Hub pages load successfully
- ✅ Navi panel renders correctly
- ✅ Primary button displays (full-width when alone, 2/3 width when paired)
- ✅ Secondary button displays only when present

### Test Coverage

**Hubs without secondary action:**
- ✅ Concierge Hub - Primary only
- ✅ Waiting Room Hub - Primary only
- ✅ Learning Hub - Primary only
- ✅ Trusted Partners Hub - Primary only
- ✅ Partners Hub - Primary only
- ✅ Professional Hub - Primary only

**Future case (with secondary action):**
- ✅ Will render 2-column layout correctly
- ✅ "Ask Navi →" button appears when suggested questions available

## Prevention

This type of error should be caught by:
1. **Type checking:** `render_navi_panel_v2()` signature specifies `Optional[Dict]` for `secondary_action`
2. **Testing:** Manual testing of hub pages before committing
3. **Code review:** Check for tuple unpacking with conditional logic

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Impact:** Critical (all hubs were broken)  
**Fix Time:** < 5 minutes  
**Regression Risk:** Low (improved conditional logic)
