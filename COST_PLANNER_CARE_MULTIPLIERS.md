# Cost Planner - Care Multipliers Specification

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**  
**Scope:** Comprehensive care cost adjustments based on GCP assessment flags

---

## Overview

Implemented realistic care multipliers that apply to the Quick Estimate based on specific care needs identified in the Guided Care Plan (GCP). These multipliers reflect the **actual increased cost** of providing specialized care for various conditions and severity levels.

---

## Care Multipliers (8 Total)

All multipliers are **cumulative** — each applies to the running total after previous adjustments.

### 1. Severe Cognitive Impairment (+20%)

**Trigger:** `memory_support` flag  
**Rationale:** Alzheimer's/dementia requiring specialized memory care environment

**Why 20%?**
- Specialized staff training in dementia care
- Enhanced security systems (wander guards, locked units)
- Specialized programming and activities
- Increased staff-to-resident ratios
- Memory care units command premium pricing

**Example:**
- Base: $6,500 (Memory Care)
- After regional (15%): $7,475
- **After cognitive (+20%): $8,970**

---

### 2. Serious Mobility/Transferring Issues (+15%)

**Trigger:** `mobility_limited` flag  
**Rationale:** Wheelchair or bedbound status requiring lifting assistance and accessible environment

**Why 15%?**
- Mechanical lift equipment required
- Two-person transfers for safety
- Specialized wheelchair-accessible rooms
- Physical therapy integration
- Higher injury risk requires increased supervision

**Example:**
- Running total: $8,970
- **After mobility (+15%): $10,315.50**

---

### 3. High-Level ADL Support (+10%)

**Trigger:** `adl_support_high` flag  
**Rationale:** Extensive help with multiple activities of daily living (bathing, dressing, eating, toileting)

**Why 10%?**
- Increased hands-on care time per day
- More frequent staff interventions
- Specialized equipment (shower chairs, adaptive utensils)
- Typically requires higher staff-to-resident ratio
- Standard for residents needing help with 4+ ADLs

**Example:**
- Running total: $10,315.50
- **After ADL support (+10%): $11,347.05**

---

### 4. Complex Medication Management (+8%)

**Trigger:** `medication_management` flag  
**Rationale:** Multiple prescriptions requiring professional oversight and administration

**Why 8%?**
- Licensed nursing required for administration
- Multiple daily med passes (not just AM/PM)
- Medication reconciliation and monitoring
- Coordination with multiple prescribers
- Documentation and regulatory compliance

**Example:**
- Running total: $11,347.05
- **After medication (+8%): $12,254.81**

---

### 5. Behavioral/Psychiatric Care (+12%)

**Trigger:** `behavioral_concerns` flag  
**Rationale:** Wandering, aggression, or other behaviors requiring specialized behavioral support

**Why 12%?**
- Specialized behavioral health training for staff
- Increased supervision and 1:1 care during episodes
- Behavioral management plans
- Coordination with psychiatric professionals
- Risk management and safety protocols
- Often requires dedicated behavioral health unit

**Example:**
- Running total: $12,254.81
- **After behavioral (+12%): $13,725.39**

---

### 6. Fall Risk/Safety Monitoring (+8%)

**Trigger:** `falls_risk` flag  
**Rationale:** 2+ falls in past year requiring enhanced supervision and safety measures

**Why 8%?**
- Bed/chair alarms and monitoring systems
- Increased supervision and check-ins
- Environmental modifications (grab bars, non-slip flooring)
- Physical therapy assessments
- Fall prevention protocols
- Documentation and incident reporting

**Example:**
- Running total: $13,725.39
- **After fall risk (+8%): $14,823.42**

---

### 7. Multiple Chronic Conditions (+10%)

**Trigger:** `chronic_conditions` flag  
**Rationale:** Multiple health conditions requiring coordinated medical oversight

**Why 10%?**
- Coordinated care across multiple specialists
- More frequent vital sign monitoring
- Complex care planning and documentation
- Increased nursing oversight
- Medical equipment and supplies
- Higher acuity = higher costs

**Example:**
- Running total: $14,823.42
- **After chronic conditions (+10%): $16,305.76**

---

### 8. High-Acuity Intensive Care (+25%)

**Trigger:** Care tier = `memory_care_high_acuity` (always applied for this tier)  
**Rationale:** Intensive 24/7 skilled nursing and advanced medical support

**Why 25%?**
- 24/7 skilled nursing (RN/LPN on every shift)
- Advanced medical equipment and monitoring
- Ability to handle complex medical needs
- Hospice-level care capability
- Wound care, IV therapy, feeding tubes
- Highest staff-to-resident ratios
- Most expensive tier of care

**Example:**
- Running total: $16,305.76
- **After high-acuity (+25%): $20,382.20**

## Display Format

Each add-on shown with:
- **Bold heading** with percentage and dollar amount
- **Caption** (indented with ↳) explaining what's included

Example:
```
**+ Severe Cognitive Impairment:** +20% ($1,495)
   ↳ Specialized memory care for Alzheimer's/dementia
```

---

## Flags Not Used for Cost Multipliers

Some GCP flags represent situational factors but don't directly increase facility costs:

### `isolation_risk`
- **Reason:** Social isolation is addressed through programming, not higher costs
- **Impact:** May inform care planning but doesn't change facility pricing

### `safety_concerns`
- **Reason:** Overlap with `falls_risk` flag
- **Impact:** Already covered by fall risk monitoring if applicable

### `caregiver_stress`
- **Reason:** Relates to family caregiver, not care recipient's needs
- **Impact:** Doesn't affect facility costs directly

## Technical Implementation

### Detection Logic

```python
# Get flags from GCP via MCIP
gcp_rec = MCIP.get_care_recommendation()
flags = []
if gcp_rec and hasattr(gcp_rec, 'flags'):
    flags = [f.get('id') if isinstance(f, dict) else f for f in gcp_rec.flags]

# Check each flag and apply multiplier
if "memory_support" in flags:
    cognitive_addon = running_total * 0.20
    breakdown["severe_cognitive_addon"] = cognitive_addon
    running_total += cognitive_addon
```

### Cumulative Application

**Critical:** Each multiplier applies to the **running total**, not the base cost.

**Correct (Cumulative):**
```python
base = 6500
after_regional = base * 1.15          # $7,475
after_cognitive = after_regional * 1.20  # $8,970
after_mobility = after_cognitive * 1.15  # $10,315.50
```

**Incorrect (Additive):**
```python
base = 6500
total_multiplier = 1.15 + 0.20 + 0.15  # Wrong!
final = base * total_multiplier
```

---

## Validation Rules

### No Duplicates
- Only one flag per category should be present
- Example: Can't have both `memory_support` and `behavioral_concerns` as cognitive triggers
- GCP logic ensures mutually exclusive flags

### Realistic Combinations
**Common:**
- Memory Care + Mobility + ADL Support
- Assisted Living + Medication + Chronic Conditions
- Memory Care High Acuity + multiple flags (most expensive scenario)

**Unlikely:**
- No Care Needed + any severity flags (contradictory)
- In-Home Care + High Acuity (would need facility-based care)

---

## User Experience

### Transparency
All multipliers are **explicitly shown** with explanations:
- Users see exactly what drives costs
- No hidden fees or surprise charges
- Educational value: helps understand care complexity

### Reassurance
After breakdown, we show:
> "We know these numbers can feel overwhelming. Don't worry — we'll help you plan how to cover these costs."

### Context
Each add-on includes a caption explaining **why** it increases costs, helping families understand the value of specialized care.
