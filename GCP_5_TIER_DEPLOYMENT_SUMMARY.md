# GCP 5-Tier System - Deployment Summary

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Commit:** 72c5f0c  
**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED - Ready for Testing**  
**Priority:** 🔴 **CRITICAL - FOUNDATIONAL CHANGE**

---

## What Changed

### ✅ **Implemented 5-Tier Care Recommendation System**

Replaced legacy 4-tier system with standardized 5-tier model that removes all ambiguous and out-of-scope terminology.

### The 5 Tiers (ONLY)

| # | Tier | Internal Key | Points | Monthly Cost |
|---|------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | **No Care Needed** | `no_care_needed` | 0-8 | ~$500 |
| 2 | **In-Home Care** | `in_home` | 9-16 | ~$3,500 |
| 3 | **Assisted Living** | `assisted_living` | 17-24 | ~$4,500 |
| 4 | **Memory Care** | `memory_care` | 25-39 | ~$6,500 |
| 5 | **Memory Care (High Acuity)** | `memory_care_high_acuity` | 40-100 | ~$9,000 |

### ❌ Removed Terms
- "Independent Living" → replaced by "No Care Needed"
- "Skilled Nursing" → replaced by "Memory Care (High Acuity)"
- All other legacy/out-of-scope tier labels

## Files Modified (8 Total)

### Core Logic
1. **`products/gcp_v4/modules/care_recommendation/logic.py`**
   - Updated `TIER_THRESHOLDS` with 5 tiers
   - Added `VALID_TIERS` constant for validation
   - Updated `_determine_tier()` to validate and raise `ValueError` for invalid tiers
   - Updated `tier_labels` dictionary with exact display names
   - Added special message for "No Care Needed" tier

### Integration Points
2. **`core/mcip.py`** - Updated tier_map for product summaries
3. **`products/cost_planner_v2/intro.py`** - Updated selectbox options and care_type_map
4. **`products/cost_planner_v2/utils/cost_calculator.py`** - Added pricing for all 5 tiers
5. **`core/modules/engine.py`** - Updated recommendation display and confidence thresholds
6. **`hubs/concierge.py`** - Updated tier_map for contextual messaging
7. **`products/gcp_v4/modules/care_recommendation/module.json`** - Updated intro to list 5 options

### Documentation
8. **`GCP_5_TIER_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - Comprehensive technical documentation
9. **`GCP_5_TIER_TESTING_GUIDE.md`** - Complete testing checklist and procedures

## Key Features

### 1. **Tier Validation**
```python
VALID_TIERS = {'no_care_needed', 'in_home', 'assisted_living', 'memory_care', 'memory_care_high_acuity'}

if tier not in VALID_TIERS:
    raise ValueError(f"Invalid tier '{tier}' - must be one of {VALID_TIERS}")
```

**Why:** Prevents invalid tier names from propagating through the system.

### 2. **"No Care Needed" Special Messaging**
When a user scores 0-8 points:
```
✓ No formal care is needed at this time. If circumstances 
  change, return to update your assessment.
```

**Why:** Provides reassurance and encourages return visits if circumstances change.

### 3. **Memory Care Split**
- **Memory Care (25-39 points):** Standard memory care for moderate cognitive decline
- **Memory Care (High Acuity) (40-100 points):** Intensive 24/7 care for advanced dementia

**Why:** Distinguishes standard vs. high-acuity memory care needs with significantly different cost profiles.

### 4. **Consistent Terminology**
All tier references now use the exact same 5 display names across:
- GCP results page
- Cost Planner dropdown
- MCIP product summaries
- Hub tile displays
- Navi panel context
- Confidence improvement UI

**Why:** Eliminates confusion from inconsistent terminology.

## Downstream Impact

### ✅ **Fully Integrated Components**

| Component | Status | What Changed |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **GCP Logic** | ✅ Updated | Tier thresholds, validation, display names |
| **Cost Planner V2** | ✅ Updated | Dropdown options, pricing for all 5 tiers |
| **MCIP** | ✅ Updated | Product summary display names |
| **Module Engine** | ✅ Updated | Results display, confidence boundaries |
| **Concierge Hub** | ✅ Updated | Contextual messaging by tier |
| **Module Intro** | ✅ Updated | Lists all 5 possible recommendations |

### ⚠️ **Components Requiring Future Updates**

| Component | Status | Action Needed |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **FAQ** | ⚠️ Partially Updated | References "skilled nursing" in Medicare context (OK), may need tier-based filtering update |
| **Additional Services** | ⚠️ Unknown | May need tier name updates for filtering |
| **Navi Dialogue** | ⚠️ Unknown | May have hardcoded tier references in prompts |
| **Legacy Cost Planner (v1)** | ⚠️ Not Updated | Consider archiving |
| **Documentation (.md files)** | ⚠️ Many Legacy References | Archive or update historical docs |

---

## Testing Status

### ✅ **Code Validation Complete**
- All 8 modified files compile without errors
- `get_errors()` returned 0 errors
- Git commit successful (72c5f0c)
- App restarted successfully at http://localhost:8501

### 🔄 **Manual Testing Required**

**See:** `GCP_5_TIER_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for complete test suite.

**Priority Tests:**
1. ✅ Complete GCP with each score range (0-8, 9-16, 17-24, 25-39, 40-100)
2. ✅ Verify tier display names are correct
3. ✅ Test Cost Planner dropdown shows all 5 options
4. ✅ Verify pricing for each tier
5. ✅ Test GCP → Cost Planner flow
6. ✅ Check Hub tile displays correct tier
7. ✅ Test confidence improvement boundaries
8. ✅ Verify no "Independent Living" or "Skilled Nursing" in UI

**Estimated Testing Time:** 30-45 minutes

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. **Legacy Data:** Users with old tier="independent" will see fallback display
2. **FAQ References:** Still mentions "skilled nursing" in Medicare context (intentional)
3. **Old Cost Planner (v1):** Not updated, should be archived
4. **No Migration Script:** Legacy user data not automatically converted

### Future Enhancements
1. **Data Migration:** Convert old tier names to new 5-tier system
2. **Additional Services Update:** Ensure filtering uses new tier names
3. **Navi Personalization:** Tier-specific guidance in AI responses
4. **Analytics:** Track tier distribution and user outcomes
5. **Regional Variations:** Adjust tier thresholds based on regional norms
6. **Tier Confidence:** Show confidence for each tier (not just recommended)

---

## Emergency Procedures

### If Critical Issue Found in Production

**Step 1: Immediate Rollback**
```bash
cd /Users/shane/Desktop/cca_senior_navigator_v3
git revert 72c5f0c
git push origin feature/cost_planner_v2
```

**Step 2: Restart App**
```bash
lsof -ti:8501 | xargs kill -9
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501
```

**Step 3: Document Issue**
- Exact error message
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Terminal output
- Browser console output

**Step 4: Create GitHub Issue**
Tag as: `bug`, `critical`, `5-tier-system`

---

## Success Criteria

### ✅ **Definition of Success**

1. **User completes GCP** → sees one of exactly 5 tier names
2. **User navigates to Cost Planner** → sees all 5 options in dropdown
3. **User calculates cost** → pricing matches tier recommendation
4. **User returns to Hub** → sees correct tier in summary
5. **User asks Navi** → Navi uses correct tier terminology
6. **No errors** in terminal or browser console
7. **No legacy terms** ("Independent Living", "Skilled Nursing") in user-facing UI

### 📊 **Metrics to Track**

- **Tier Distribution:** How many users in each tier?
- **Boundary Cases:** How many users at tier boundaries (low clarity)?
- **Tier Transitions:** Do users retake GCP and change tiers?
- **Cost Planner Usage:** Which tiers most commonly explore costs?
- **Error Rate:** Any ValueError for invalid tiers? (should be 0)
