## chime.mp3

Placeholder for notification chime sound (â‰¤ 50 KB).

To add the chime:
1. Place a short, soft notification chime at `chime.mp3`
2. Recommended: 0.5-1.0 second duration, gentle tone
3. Format: MP3, 44.1 kHz, mono/stereo

The app handles missing audio gracefully - if chime.mp3 is not found, notifications will display without sound.
