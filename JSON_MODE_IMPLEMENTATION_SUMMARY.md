# JSON-Driven Mode System: Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Branch:** feature/basic-advanced-mode-exploration  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Proof of Concept Complete

---

## What We Built

A complete **JSON-driven Basic/Advanced mode system** where:
- **Configuration lives in JSON** (what to show, how to behave)
- **Logic lives in Python** (calculations, rendering)
- **Unallocated = 0 in calculations** (detail fields only)

---

## JSON Configuration Structure

### Section-Level (What Shows in Each Mode)

```json
{
  "mode_config": {
    "supports_basic_advanced": true,
    "basic_mode_aggregate": "cash_liquid_total",
    "advanced_mode_fields": ["checking_balance", "savings_cds_balance"]
  }
}
```

### Field-Level (How It Behaves)

```json
{
  "key": "cash_liquid_total",
  "type": "aggregate_input",
  "aggregate_from": ["checking_balance", "savings_cds_balance"],
  
  "mode_behavior": {
    "basic": {
      "display": "input",
      "editable": true,
      "distribution_strategy": "even",
      "help": "Enter total. We'll split evenly."
    },
    "advanced": {
      "display": "calculated_label",
      "editable": false,
      "help": "Calculated automatically."
    }
  },
  
  "unallocated": {
    "enabled": true,
    "show_in_mode": "advanced",
    "actions": ["clear_original", "move_to_other"],
    "other_field_key": "liquid_assets_other",
    "label": "Unallocated Liquid Assets",
    "help": "Not included in calculations."
  }
}
```

### Field Visibility

```json
{
  "key": "checking_balance",
  "type": "currency",
  "visible_in_modes": ["advanced"]
}
```

## Python Engine API

### Core Functions

```python
from core.mode_engine import (
    render_mode_toggle,           # Show mode toggle UI
    show_mode_guidance,            # Display mode help
    get_visible_fields,            # Filter fields by mode
    render_aggregate_field,        # Mode-aware rendering
    calculate_aggregate,           # Sum detail fields
    distribute_aggregate,          # Split aggregate value
    render_unallocated_field       # Show discrepancy
)
```

### Usage Example

```python
# 1. Show mode toggle
current_mode = render_mode_toggle("assets")

# 2. Get visible fields for mode
visible_fields = get_visible_fields(section_config, current_mode)

# 3. Render aggregate field
for field in visible_fields:
    if field["type"] == "aggregate_input":
        updates = render_aggregate_field(field, state, current_mode)
        if updates:
            state.update(updates)
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Unallocated = Zero in Calculations ‚≠ê
**Problem:** User enters $100k estimate, actual is $70k. What happens to $30k?

**Solution:** Unallocated is purely informational. Calculations only use detail fields.

**Result:**
- Net Assets = $70k (correct!)
- Unallocated shows $30k (informational)
- User can: ignore, clear, or move to "Other"

**Rating:** 10/10 - Eliminates phantom money problem

### 2. JSON-Driven Configuration ‚≠ê
**Problem:** Adding new mode-enabled sections requires code changes.

**Solution:** Configuration lives in JSON, Python reads and executes.

**Result:**
- Zero code changes to add new sections
- Consistent behavior across all sections
- Designer-friendly (non-developers can configure)

**Rating:** 9.5/10 - Huge maintainability win

### 3. Distribution Strategies
**Options:**
- `even`: Split equally across all fields
- `proportional`: Maintain existing ratios

**Default:** Even split (simpler, more predictable)

### 4. Mode Toggle Placement
**Decision:** At top of assessment (before any questions)

**Rationale:**
- User decides complexity level upfront
- No context switching mid-assessment
- Clear expectation setting

---

## Sections Enhanced (Proof of Concept)

### 1. Liquid Assets üí∞
- **Basic mode:** Single "Total Liquid Assets" input
- **Advanced mode:** Checking + Savings/CDs + Other
- **Distribution:** Even split across checking/savings
- **Unallocated:** Can move to "Other" field

### 2. Investments üìà
- **Basic mode:** Single "Total Investments" input
- **Advanced mode:** Mutual Funds/ETFs + Stocks/Bonds
- **Distribution:** Even split across both
- **Unallocated:** Can move to Stocks/Bonds

### 3. Retirement Accounts üè¶
- **Basic mode:** Single "Total Retirement" input
- **Advanced mode:** Traditional IRA/401(k) + Roth IRA
- **Distribution:** Even split across both
- **Unallocated:** Can move to Traditional
