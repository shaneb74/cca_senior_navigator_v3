## ‚ú® Major Changes

### 1. **Navi Styling Update**

- Removed "Continue as Guest" option
- Single sign-in path only
- HIPAA compliance messaging
- Cleaner, more focused UX

### 3. **Triage Page Redesign**
- Replaced complex "Your Current Situation" with 3 simple questions:
  - Are you on Medicaid/State Assistance?
  - Are you a Veteran?
  - Do you own your home?
- Checkbox format with numbered questions
- Persists to profile for future use
- Takes 10 seconds instead of 2 minutes

### 4. **Financial Assessment Hub**
- Functions as mini-hub with 6 financial modules
- **2-column grid layout** for better space utilization
- **Centered content** (1-6-1 column ratio) under Navi
- Conditional module visibility based on qualifiers:
  - VA Benefits (visible if veteran)
  - Medicaid Navigation (visible if on Medicaid)
  - Income, Assets, Health Insurance, Life Insurance (always visible)
- Required badges on Income and Assets modules
- Status indicators: Not Started, In Progress (üîÑ), Completed (‚úÖ)

### 5. **Module Tiles**
- Clean native Streamlit components (no complex HTML)
- Large emoji icons (48px)
- Title with required badge and status
- Description and time estimate

  - Activates when ready
  - Auto-publishes to MCIP before proceeding

### 7. **Resume Functionality**
- Cost Planner tile on Concierge Hub shows "Resume" when in Financial Assessment
- Detects `cost_v2_step` and presence of module/qualifier data
- Clicking "Resume" skips Quick Estimate
- Takes user directly to Financial Assessment hub
- Preserves all progress, qualifiers, and module data
- First-time users still see "Get a Quick Cost Estimate"

### 8. **Contextual Navi Messages**
Each step has specific Navi guidance:
- **Intro:** "Let's look at costs" (with GCP recommendation if available)
- **Auth:** "Sign in to continue" + HIPAA reassurance
- **Triage:** "Just a few quick questions" + personalization explanation
- **Modules:** "Let's work through these financial modules together" + purpose explanation
