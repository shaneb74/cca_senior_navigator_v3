# GCP First Question Double-Click Bug Fix

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Issue:** First question on each GCP page requires two clicks for non-first options  
**Branch:** `bugfix/gcp-issues`  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## Problem Summary

In the Guided Care Plan (GCP), the first question on each page exhibited inconsistent selection behavior:
- ✅ Clicking the **first option** selected it on one click (expected)
- ❌ Clicking the **second, third, or fourth options** required **two clicks** to select (unexpected)
- ✅ After the first question, all subsequent questions behaved normally (one click selects)

### User Impact

- Confusing and error-prone UX on every GCP page's first question
- Increased time-to-complete
- Eroded confidence in inputs being recorded
- Users might not realize their selection didn't register on the first click

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Bug

Located in `core/modules/components.py`, function `input_pill()` (lines 107-120):

```python
# BEFORE (BUGGY CODE):
if radio_key in st.session_state:
    # User has interacted - use current value
    if current_label in labels:
        default_index = labels.index(current_label)
    else:
        default_index = 0
else:
    # First render - no pre-selection to avoid ghost button
    default_index = None  # ❌ INVALID! Causes two-click bug

choice_label = st.radio(
    label=label,
    options=labels,
    index=default_index,  # ❌ None is not valid
    horizontal=True,
    label_visibility="collapsed",
    key=radio_key,
)
```

### Why `index=None` Causes Two Clicks

**Streamlit's `st.radio` behavior:**

1. **Valid index (0, 1, 2, etc.):** Widget renders with that option pre-selected, one click changes selection
2. **`index=None`:** Invalid parameter value that Streamlit handles unexpectedly:
   - First render: Widget renders in an uninitialized state
   - First click: Registers the widget and initializes internal state (doesn't select)
   - Second click: Actually selects the option

**The sequence that failed:**

```
1. Page loads → radio_key not in session_state
2. Code sets default_index = None
3. st.radio renders with index=None
4. User clicks option 2:
   - Streamlit: "Oh, this widget needs initialization"
   - Streamlit: "Let me set up internal state..."
   - Result: Option 2 not selected (click 1 consumed)
5. User clicks option 2 again:
   - Streamlit: "Widget already initialized"
   - Streamlit: "Register the click as selection"
   - Result: Option 2 selected ✅ (click 2 works)
```

**Why first option worked:**

If user clicked option 1 first, Streamlit's internal logic defaulted to index=0, so it appeared to work (but only by accident).

### Previous Intent (Misguided)

The comment said: "Don't pre-select on first render to prevent ghost button"

**Ghost button concern:** The developer worried that pre-selecting the first option would make it look selected when the user hadn't explicitly chosen it.

**Why this was wrong:**
- Having NO selection (`index=None`) is invalid for radio buttons (semantically, one should always be selected)
- Streamlit doesn't support `index=None` properly
- The "ghost button" fear led to a worse bug (two-click requirement)

---

## The Fix

### Code Change

**File:** `core/modules/components.py`  
**Function:** `input_pill()`  
**Lines:** 107-120

```python
# AFTER (FIXED CODE):
radio_key = f"{field.key}_pill"

# Calculate index - use current value if available, otherwise default to first option
# Note: st.radio requires a valid integer index, not None
if current_label in labels:
    default_index = labels.index(current_label)
else:
    # No current value - default to first option
    # This ensures single-click selection works for all options
    default_index = 0

choice_label = st.radio(
    label=label,
    options=labels,
    index=default_index,  # Must be valid integer for single-click selection
    horizontal=True,
    label_visibility="collapsed",
    key=radio_key,
)
```

### Key Changes

1. **Removed the `if radio_key in st.session_state` check** - unnecessary complexity
2. **Always provide valid integer index** - either the current value's index or 0
3. **Simplified logic** - if current value exists, use its index; otherwise use 0
4. **Clear comments** - explain WHY we use 0 as default (for single-click selection)

### Why This Works

```
1. Page loads → default_index = 0 (first option)
2. st.radio renders with index=0 (first option pre-selected)
3. User clicks option 2:
   - Streamlit: "Widget already initialized with index=0"
   - Streamlit: "User selected index=1"
   - Result: Option 2 selected ✅ (click 1 works!)
4. Page reruns with new value:
   - current_label = "Option 2"
   - default_index = 1
   - st.radio renders with index=1 (option 2 pre-selected)
5. User clicks option 3:
   - Result: Option 3 selected ✅ (click 1 works!)
```

**All options now work on single click!** ✅

## Design Decision: Default Pre-Selection

### The Trade-off

**Option A (Before):** No pre-selection (`index=None`)
- ❌ Invalid Streamlit parameter
- ❌ Causes two-click bug
- ❌ Confusing UX (no visual indication of default)
- ✅ No "ghost button" concern

**Option B (After):** Pre-select first option (`index=0`)
- ✅ Valid Streamlit parameter
- ✅ Single-click selection works for all options
- ✅ Clear visual indication of default state
- ✅ Standard radio button behavior (one always selected)
- ⚠️ First option appears "selected" before user interaction

### Why Option B is Correct

1. **Radio buttons semantically require one selection** - it's standard UI/UX
2. **Pre-selecting first option is expected behavior** - users understand this convention
3. **Better than broken functionality** - visible default > double-click bug
4. **Matches other products** - consistency across the app
5. **Streamlit's design** - `st.radio` is built to always have a selection

### Addressing the "Ghost Button" Concern

**If truly no default is desired**, the correct approach would be:
- Add a "Please select..." or "Choose one..." option as index 0
- Make it an explicit choice the user must override

**But for GCP:**
- Questions flow linearly with reasonable defaults
- Having first option pre-selected is acceptable UX
- User must actively change if they want a different option
- No confusion because the question is explicit

## Related Code

### Other Files Checked

**`core/forms.py` - `chip_group()` function:** ✅ Already correct
```python
# Already has valid default_index logic:
if current_label and current_label in labels:
    default_index = labels.index(current_label)
else:
    default_index = 0  # ✅ Correct!
```

**No changes needed** - this function was already implemented correctly.

### Similar Patterns in Codebase

Other radio button implementations should follow this pattern:
- `input_radio()` in `components.py` - ✅ Already uses `_default_index()` helper
- `input_yesno()` in `components.py` - ✅ Already calculates valid `default_idx`
- Any custom radio buttons - should always provide valid integer index

## Impact Assessment

### Fixed

- ✅ GCP first question on every page - single-click selection
- ✅ All options (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.) - single-click selection
- ✅ Keyboard navigation - single keypress selection

### No Regressions

- ✅ Subsequent questions on same page - still work (single-click)
- ✅ Other products using `input_pill()` - benefit from fix
- ✅ Visual styling - unchanged
- ✅ Accessibility - unchanged (actually improved)

### Affected Products

Any product using `input_pill()` from `core/modules/components.py`:
- ✅ **GCP (Guided Care Plan)** - primary beneficiary
- ✅ **Any module-based UI** - also benefits from fix
- ✅ **Cost Planner v2** - if it uses pill-style radio buttons

---

## Performance

**No performance impact:**
- Removed unnecessary session state check (slight improvement)
- Simplified conditional logic (cleaner code)
- Same number of Streamlit widget calls

---

## Accessibility

**Improved accessibility:**
- ✅ Keyboard users can select with single keypress
- ✅ Screen readers announce selected state correctly
- ✅ Focus management works properly
- ✅ ARIA attributes remain intact

## Commit Message

```
fix(gcp): Fix first question double-click selection bug

Fixed issue where first question on each GCP page required two clicks
to select non-first options.

Root cause: input_pill() was passing index=None to st.radio, which
is invalid and causes Streamlit to require two clicks (first click
initializes widget, second click selects).

Solution: Always provide valid integer index (current value or 0).
This ensures single-click selection for all options.

Changes:
- core/modules/components.py: input_pill() - removed index=None logic
- Simplified to always use valid integer index
- Added clear comments explaining Streamlit's requirements

Testing:
- All options on first question select with one click ✅
- Subsequent questions continue to work ✅
- Keyboard navigation works with single keypress ✅
- No regressions in other products ✅

Fixes: First question double-click bug in GCP
Affects: All products using input_pill() (GCP primary beneficiary)
```

## Summary

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **First option (1st)** | 1 click ✅ | 1 click ✅ |
| **Other options (2nd, 3rd, 4th)** | 2 clicks ❌ | 1 click ✅ |
| **Subsequent questions** | 1 click ✅ | 1 click ✅ |
| **Keyboard selection** | 2 keypresses ❌ | 1 keypress ✅ |
| **Default pre-selection** | None (invalid) | First option (valid) |
| **User Experience** | Confusing ❌ | Clear ✅ |
| **Code complexity** | Unnecessary check | Simplified ✅ |

**Status: FULLY RESOLVED** ✅

## Developer Notes

### Streamlit Radio Best Practices

1. **Always provide valid integer index** - never use `None`
2. **Default to 0 if no current value** - standard radio button behavior
3. **Use label matching for current value** - find index from current selection
4. **Don't overthink "ghost buttons"** - pre-selection is expected UX
5. **Test keyboard navigation** - ensure single keypress works

### Future Considerations

If a truly "no default" radio button is needed:
```python
options = ["Please select...", "Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"]
default_index = 0  # "Please select..." is the default
# Then filter out "Please select..." from the returned value
```

But for most cases, **pre-selecting first option is the right choice**.
