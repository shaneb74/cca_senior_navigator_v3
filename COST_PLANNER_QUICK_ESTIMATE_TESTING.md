‚úÖ **PASS if:** No legacy tier names in Quick Estimate UI

---

### Test 9: Math Validation
**Example:** Memory Care, ZIP 90210 (15% regional), with cognitive (+20%) and mobility (+15%)

**Expected Calculation:**
```
Base: $6,500
After regional (15%): $6,500 √ó 1.15 = $7,475
After cognitive (+20%): $7,475 √ó 1.20 = $8,970
After mobility (+15%): $8,970 √ó 1.15 = $10,315.50
Total: $10,315.50/month
```

**Verify:**
- Base cost line: $6,500
- Regional line: +15% ($975)
- Cognitive line: +20% ($1,495)
- Mobility line: +15% ($1,345.50)
- **Total: $10,315.50**

‚úÖ **PASS if:** Math is correct (cumulative add-ons)

### Test 10: CTA Navigation
1. Calculate estimate
2. Click "‚û°Ô∏è Continue to Full Assessment"
3. **Expected:** Navigates to authentication page (or Full Assessment if already logged in)
4. **Expected:** Context preserved (care type, ZIP)

‚úÖ **PASS if:** CTA triggers correct workflow
