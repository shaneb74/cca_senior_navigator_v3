# Cost Planner v2 Persistence Bug Fix

**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Issue:** Cost Planner assessment data not persisting across app restarts  
**Root Cause:** Missing persistence configuration  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## The Problem

User reported that Cost Planner v2 data was not persisting when restarting `app.py`. Multiple user data files were created (e.g., `anon_d2c42550e6a3.json`, `anon_325a505188fa.json`), which was expected behavior, but the data was lost on app restart.

### Initial Hypothesis (INCORRECT)
We initially thought this was expected behavior due to:
1. New browser session = new UID generated
2. UID maintained via URL query param `?uid=anon_xxx`
3. Data saved per UID, so new UID = different file

### Actual Root Cause (CORRECT)
Cost Planner v2 state keys were **never configured for persistence** in `core/session_store.py`.

The app was saving data to `st.session_state` correctly, but:
- ❌ `USER_PERSIST_KEYS` did NOT include any `cost_v2_*` or `cost_planner_v2_*` keys
- ❌ Data never written to user JSON files
- ❌ Even with same UID, data couldn't be restored (it was never saved)

---

## The Fix

### File Modified
`core/session_store.py` - Added 17 Cost Planner keys to `USER_PERSIST_KEYS`

### Keys Added
```python
USER_PERSIST_KEYS = {
    # ... existing keys ...
    
    # Cost Planner v2 state keys
    "cost_v2_step",              # Current wizard step
    "cost_v2_guest_mode",        # Guest vs authenticated mode
    "cost_v2_triage",            # Triage assessment results
    "cost_v2_qualifiers",        # Initial qualifiers (medicaid, veteran, homeowner)
    "cost_v2_current_module",    # Currently active assessment module
    "cost_v2_modules",           # ⭐ MAIN ASSESSMENT DATA (all module states)
    "cost_v2_income",            # Income assessment data
    "cost_v2_assets",            # Assets assessment data
    "cost_v2_va_benefits",       # VA benefits assessment data
    "cost_v2_health_insurance",  # Health insurance assessment data
    "cost_v2_life_insurance",    # Life insurance assessment data
    "cost_v2_medicaid_navigation", # Medicaid navigation data
    "cost_v2_advisor_notes",     # Advisor notes
    "cost_v2_schedule_advisor",  # Advisor scheduling data
    "cost_v2_quick_estimate",    # Quick estimate from intro
    "cost_planner_v2_published", # Publication status
    "cost_planner_v2_complete",  # Completion status
}
```

### Most Critical Key
**`cost_v2_modules`** - This is the main data structure containing all assessment module states, including the financial assessment data that was being lost.

---

## How Persistence Works

### Before Fix
1. User fills out assessments → Data saved to `st.session_state["cost_v2_modules"]`
2. App calls `save_user(uid, extract_user_state(st.session_state))`
3. `extract_user_state()` filters for keys in `USER_PERSIST_KEYS`
4. ❌ None of the `cost_v2_*` keys matched → No data written to file
5. App restart → Load user data → Empty, because nothing was saved

### After Fix
1. User fills out assessments → Data saved to `st.session_state["cost_v2_modules"]`
2. App calls `save_user(uid, extract_user_state(st.session_state))`
3. `extract_user_state()` filters for keys in `USER_PERSIST_KEYS`
4. ✅ All `cost_v2_*` keys matched → Data written to `data/users/{uid}.json`
5. App restart → Load user data → All Cost Planner data restored

---

## Testing Steps

### Verify the Fix
1. **Start app and enter Cost Planner data:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   - Navigate to Cost Planner
   - Fill out some assessment fields
   - Note your UID from URL: `?uid=anon_xxxxxxxxxx`

2. **Check user file contains data:**
   ```bash
   cat data/users/anon_xxxxxxxxxx.json | jq '.cost_v2_modules'
   ```
   Should show assessment data (not empty or null)

3. **Restart app with same UID:**
   - Bookmark URL: `http://localhost:8501/?uid=anon_xxxxxxxxxx`
   - Stop app (Ctrl+C)
   - Restart: `streamlit run app.py`
   - Navigate to bookmarked URL
   - ✅ Data should be restored

### Expected Behavior
- **Same UID (via bookmark):** Data persists ✅
- **New browser session (no UID):** New UID generated, appears as "new user" ✅
- **Multiple devices (same UID):** Can share UID across devices for data sync ✅

## Impact Assessment

### What Was Affected
- ✅ **Financial Profile Assessment** - All 12+ fields
- ✅ **Income Assessment** - All income sources
- ✅ **Assets Assessment** - All asset types
- ✅ **VA Benefits Assessment** - All VA benefit data
- ✅ **Health Insurance Assessment** - All insurance data
- ✅ **Life Insurance Assessment** - All policy data
- ✅ **Medicaid Navigation** - All medicaid-related data
- ✅ **Expert Review State** - Recommendations and advisor notes
- ✅ **Progress Tracking** - Module completion status

### What Was NOT Affected
- ✅ Other products (MCIP, Guided Care Plan) - Already had persistence
- ✅ User profile/preferences - Already had persistence
- ✅ Tiles/badges - Already had persistence

## Related Files

### Modified
- `core/session_store.py` - Added Cost Planner keys to `USER_PERSIST_KEYS`

### Verified (No Changes Needed)
- `app.py` - Persistence logic already correct (loads on startup, saves on every render)
- `products/cost_planner_v2/**/*.py` - State management already correct (data saved to session_state)

---

## Key Learnings

### Architecture Pattern
The persistence system uses a whitelist approach:
1. All state lives in `st.session_state`
2. Only keys in `USER_PERSIST_KEYS` are saved to JSON files
3. Any new product must explicitly add its keys to persist list

### Why This Was Missed
Cost Planner v2 is a newer product that was built after the persistence system was established. The state keys were implemented but never added to the persistence configuration.

### Prevention
When adding new products/features:
1. ✅ Identify all state keys used by the feature
2. ✅ Decide which keys should persist (user data vs. temporary state)
3. ✅ Add keys to `USER_PERSIST_KEYS` or `SESSION_PERSIST_KEYS` as appropriate
4. ✅ Test persistence with app restart before considering feature complete

## Commit Message

```
fix: Add Cost Planner v2 persistence configuration

Cost Planner assessment data was not persisting across app restarts
because state keys were never added to USER_PERSIST_KEYS.

Added 17 Cost Planner keys to persistence configuration:
- cost_v2_modules (main assessment data)
- cost_v2_income, cost_v2_assets, cost_v2_va_benefits
- cost_v2_health_insurance, cost_v2_life_insurance
- cost_v2_medicaid_navigation, cost_v2_advisor_notes
- cost_v2_step, cost_v2_qualifiers, cost_v2_triage
- cost_v2_quick_estimate, cost_v2_current_module
- cost_planner_v2_published, cost_planner_v2_complete
- And 3 more workflow state keys

This fixes user-reported bug where assessment data was lost on restart.

Modified:
- core/session_store.py: Added 17 keys to USER_PERSIST_KEYS
```

## Bug #2: CostEstimate Not JSON Serializable

### The Problem
After fixing the persistence configuration, a new error appeared:
```
[ERROR] Atomic write failed: Object of type CostEstimate is not JSON serializable
```

### Root Cause
The `cost_v2_quick_estimate` data structure contained a `CostEstimate` dataclass object:
```python
st.session_state.cost_v2_quick_estimate = {
    "estimate": estimate,  # ← CostEstimate object, not JSON serializable!
    "care_tier": care_tier,
    "zip_code": zip_code,
}
```

When the persistence system tried to save this to JSON, it failed because Python's `json.dumps()` doesn't know how to serialize dataclass objects.

### The Fix

1. **Added serialization methods to CostEstimate dataclass:**
   ```python
   @dataclass
   class CostEstimate:
       # ... fields ...
       
       def to_dict(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
           """Convert to JSON-serializable dict for persistence."""
           return {
               "monthly_base": self.monthly_base,
               "monthly_adjusted": self.monthly_adjusted,
               # ... all fields ...
           }
       
       @classmethod
       def from_dict(cls, data: dict[str, Any]) -> "CostEstimate":
           """Reconstruct from dict loaded from persistence."""
           return cls(**data)
   ```

2. **Updated intro.py to store dict instead of object:**
   ```python
   st.session_state.cost_v2_quick_estimate = {
       "estimate": estimate.to_dict(),  # ✅ Now JSON serializable
       "care_tier": care_tier,
       "zip_code": zip_code,
   }
   ```

3. **Updated code that reads the estimate to handle both formats:**
   ```python
   # intro.py
   estimate_data = data["estimate"]
   if isinstance(estimate_data, dict):
       estimate = CostEstimate.from_dict(estimate_data)
   else:
       estimate = estimate_data  # Legacy support
   
   # expert_review.py
   if isinstance(estimate_data, dict):
       estimated_monthly_cost = estimate_data["monthly_adjusted"]
   else:
       estimated_monthly_cost = estimate_data.monthly_adjusted
   ```

### Files Modified
- `products/cost_planner_v2/utils/cost_calculator.py` - Added to_dict() and from_dict()
- `products/cost_planner_v2/intro.py` - Save dict, reconstruct on read
- `products/cost_planner_v2/expert_review.py` - Handle both dict and object formats

### Why Backward Compatibility?
The code handles both dict and object formats because:
1. Existing session_state might have CostEstimate objects from before this fix
2. Graceful degradation - app won't crash if old format encountered
3. After app restart, all new data will use dict format
