# Income Sources Page Redesign

## Overview
Redesigned the Income Sources assessment module to be more compact, scannable, and user-friendly with integrated Navi guidance.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. **Navi Integration** ‚úÖ
- **Removed:** Blue info banner with bullet points
- **Added:** Navi panel using `render_navi_panel_v2()` with conversational tone:
  - **Title:** "Let's review your income together"
  - **Reason:** Clear explanation of what we're doing and why
  - **Encouragement:** Contextual tips about expanding sections for guidance
  - **Variant:** "module" style with blue left border

### 2. **Simplified Categories** ‚úÖ
Removed Investment Income (moved to Assets & Resources):
- ‚úÖ Social Security Benefits
- ‚úÖ Pension & Annuity Income (merged into one)
- ‚úÖ Employment Income
- ‚úÖ Other Income Sources
- ‚ùå Investment Income (removed - belongs in Assets)

### 3. **Collapsible Section Groups** ‚úÖ
Created two main groups to reduce scrolling:

**üì¶ Primary Income**
- üèõÔ∏è Social Security Benefits (expanded by default)
- üìä Pension & Annuity Income (collapsed)
- üíº Employment Income (collapsed)

**üì¶ Other Income Sources**
- üíµ Other Income (collapsed)

Each section includes:
- Caption text for context
- üí° Quick Guide with bullet points
- All original input fields and tooltips

### 4. **Compact Layout** ‚úÖ
CSS updates in `assets/css/modules.css`:
- Tighter section margins (1rem instead of larger defaults)
- Reduced field spacing for inputs
- Thinner horizontal rules
- Reduced padding in module containers
- Compact metrics and captions

### 5. **Updated Navigation** ‚úÖ
- **Removed:** "Back to Hub" button (redundant)
- **Kept:** "‚Üê Back to Modules" (secondary)
- **Primary CTA:** "üíæ Save & Continue ‚Üí" (navy button, full width in right column)
- Layout: 2-column [1, 2] split for better visual hierarchy

### 6. **Enhanced Summary** ‚úÖ
- Clean metric display: "üíµ Total Monthly Income"
- Two-column breakdown of income sources (only shows non-zero values)
- Removed verbose info box

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. **`products/cost_planner_v2/modules/income.py`**
   - Imported `render_navi_panel_v2` from `core.ui`
   - Restructured with collapsible expanders
   - Removed `investment_monthly` from session state and calculations
   - Updated navigation buttons to 2-column layout
   - Added Quick Guide content within each expander

2. **`assets/css/modules.css`**
   - Added compact financial assessment CSS rules
   - Reduced vertical spacing throughout
   - Tighter expander and field margins

### Session State Changes
**Before:**
```python
{
    "ss_monthly": 0,
    "pension_monthly": 0,
    "employment_status": "not_employed",
    "employment_monthly": 0,
    "investment_monthly": 0,  # REMOVED
    "other_monthly": 0
}
```

**After:**
```python
{
    "ss_monthly": 0,
    "pension_monthly": 0,
    "employment_status": "not_employed",
    "employment_monthly": 0,
    "other_monthly": 0
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Long vertical scroll with multiple large section headers
- Blue info box taking up screen space
- Separate sections for pension and annuity
- Investment income in wrong module
- 3-column navigation with redundant "Back to Hub"

### After
- Compact, collapsible sections (fits in 1-2 scrolls on 1080p)
- Navi provides intelligent, conversational guidance
- Pension & annuity combined logically
- Investment income moved to Assets module (where it belongs)
- Clean 2-column navigation focused on next steps

## Navi Message Tone
Using **Conversational** approach:
- Warm and human
- Supportive without being patronizing
- Clear action-oriented language
- Contextual tips within each section

## Next Steps

### Recommended Follow-ups
1. **Apply same pattern to other assessment modules:**
   - Assets & Resources (add Investment Income here)
   - Monthly Costs
   - Coverage
   - Health Insurance

2. **Consider adding:**
   - Progress indicator showing which modules are complete
   - "Skip this module" option for non-applicable sections
   - Auto-save indication when values change

3. **Mobile optimization:**
   - Test expander behavior on mobile devices
   - Ensure Navi panel is readable on small screens
   - Verify 2-column layout stacks properly
