# Professional Navi Demo Implementation

## Overview
Implemented Professional-specific Navi panel for the Professionals page/hub. This is a demo-scoped implementation that shows Professional-specific content without affecting any other Navi instances in the app.

## Changes Made

### 1. **core/navi.py** - Added Professional Hub Detection
- Added conditional logic at the start of the hub rendering section
- When `hub_key == "professional"`, renders Professional-specific Navi
- All Member Hub, Cost Planner, FAQ, and other Navi instances remain unchanged

**Professional Navi Content:**
- **Title:** "Your professional dashboard"
- **Reason:** "Manage your caseload, track referrals, and coordinate care for your clients."
- **Encouragement:** üíº "Everything you need to support your patients and families."
- **Context Chips:** Caseload snapshot (Pending: 7, Referrals: 3, Updates: 5)
- **Primary Action:** "Open Dashboard" (demo, non-functional)
- **Secondary Action:** "Open CRM ‚Üí" (demo, non-functional)
- **No Progress Bar:** Professional Hub is not journey-based
- **No Alerts:** No GCP-style alerts for Professional Hub

### 2. **pages/professionals.py** - Complete Rewrite
- Changed from simple welcome card to full Professional Hub display
- Added `_build_professional_tiles()` function that creates 6 Professional tiles:
  1. Professional Dashboard (7 new actions)
  2. Client List / Search
  3. Case Management & Referrals (5 due)
  4. Scheduling + Analytics (3 due today)
  5. Recidivism Assessment / Solutions
  6. Advisor Mode Navi (CRM Query Engine) - Beta

- Uses `render_navi_panel(location="hub", hub_key="professional")` to trigger Professional Navi
- Renders tiles in standard hub body layout
- Maintains simple header/footer pattern

## Architecture Patterns

### Scoping Strategy
The Professional Navi is completely isolated through the `hub_key` parameter:

```python
if hub_key == "professional":
    # Professional-specific content
    # ... (Professional logic)
    return ctx

# All other hubs continue with existing logic
# Member Hub (Concierge) logic unchanged
```

### No Cross-Contamination
- ‚úÖ Member Hub Navi: Unchanged (uses MCIP, care recommendations, journey progress)
- ‚úÖ Cost Planner Navi: Unchanged (module-level guidance)
- ‚úÖ FAQ Navi: Unchanged (Q&A context)
- ‚úÖ Professional Navi: New, isolated, Professional-specific

### Demo Limitations (Expected)
- **No Authentication:** Professional page is accessible without role checks (authentication disabled for demo)
- **Non-Functional Links:** All Professional tile actions route to `hub_professional` (placeholder)
- **Static Data:** Caseload metrics (7 pending, 3 referrals, 5 updates) are hardcoded
- **No Backend:** No real case management, referrals, or scheduling functionality

## Visual Design

### Professional Navi Style
- Uses standard V2 Navi panel design (compact, bordered banner)
- Professional icon: üíº (briefcase)
- Professional tone: Business-focused, efficiency-oriented
- Color scheme: Inherits from standard Navi (navy/gold)

### Context Chips
Professional chips show operational metrics instead of journey progress:
- üìä **Pending:** 7 actions
- üÜï **Referrals:** 3 today  
- üìù **Updates:** 5 needed

## Testing Checklist

### Visual Verification
- [ ] Navigate to `/professionals` page
- [ ] Verify Professional Navi appears (single instance, no duplicates)
- [ ] Check title: "Your professional dashboard"
- [ ] Check context chips: Pending (7), Referrals (3), Updates (5)
- [ ] Verify 6 Professional tiles render below Navi
- [ ] Check badges on tiles (7 new, 5 due, 3 due today, Beta)

### Isolation Testing
- [ ] Navigate to Member Hub (Concierge) - verify Member Navi unchanged
- [ ] Navigate to Cost Planner - verify module Navi unchanged  
- [ ] Navigate to FAQ - verify FAQ Navi unchanged
- [ ] Navigate back to Professionals - verify Professional Navi still correct

### No Regression
- [ ] No errors in browser console
- [ ] No Python exceptions in Streamlit logs
- [ ] All other pages load correctly
- [ ] Navigation between pages works smoothly

## Future Enhancements (Post-Demo)

### Authentication
- Re-enable role-based access for Professional Hub
- Add professional login flow
