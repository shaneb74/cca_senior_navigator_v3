## Architecture & Integration

### JSON Structure Pattern

All 4 assessments follow the Income/Assets pattern:

```json
{
  "key": "assessment_name",
  "title": "Display Title",
  "icon": "🎯",
  "description": "Short description",
  "estimated_time": "X-Y min",
  "required": false,
  "sort_order": N,
  "sections": [
    {
      "id": "intro",
      "type": "intro",
      "title": "Assessment Title",
      "icon": "🎯",
      "help_text": "Single-line guidance matching Navi message",
      "fields": [],
      "info_boxes": [{"type": "info", "message": "💡 Context"}]
    },
    {
      "id": "section_id",
      "title": "Section Title",
      "icon": "📝",
      "help_text": "Section guidance",
      "layout": "single_column",
      "fields": [
        {
          "key": "field_name",
          "label": "Visible Label",
          "type": "select|currency|text|textarea|checkbox|multiselect|number",
          "required": false,
          "help": "Inline field help",
          "visible_if": {"field": "other_field", "equals": "value"}
        }
      ],
      "info_boxes": []
    },
    {
      "id": "results",
      "type": "results",
      "title": "Summary Title",
      "icon": "✅",
      "fields": []
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "type": "calculated|text",
    "label": "Summary Label",
    "formula": "sum(field1, field2)" | "text": "Summary text"
  },
  "output_contract": {
    "field_name": "type"
  }
}
```

### Renderer Integration

**Files:**
- `/products/cost_planner_v2/assessments.py` - Assessment hub and single-page renderer
- `/core/assessment_engine.py` - Field rendering engine

**Flow:**
1. Assessment hub loads all JSON configs via `_load_all_assessments()`
2. User selects assessment → `_render_assessment(assessment_key)`
3. For standard assessments → `run_assessment()` (multi-step)
4. Can add to `_SINGLE_PAGE_ASSESSMENTS` dict for single-page rendering like Income/Assets

**Single-Page Rendering:**
- Income and Assets already use `_render_single_page_assessment()`
- To enable for optional assessments, add to `_SINGLE_PAGE_ASSESSMENTS` dict with settings:
  ```python
  "assessment_key": {
      "save_label": "Save Label",
      "success_message": "Success message",
      "navi": {...},
      "expert_requires": ["income", "assets"],
      "expert_disabled_text": "Message when not ready"
  }
  ```

### Data Persistence

**Session State Path:**
```python
st.session_state.tiles.cost_planner_v2.assessments.{assessment_key}
```

**Module Registry (Backward Compatibility):**
```python
st.session_state.cost_v2_modules.{assessment_key}
```

**Augmentation:**
- `_persist_assessment_state()` writes to both locations
- `_augment_assessment_state()` handles normalization (currently only for income/assets)

### Financial Profile Integration

**Aggregation:** `/products/cost_planner_v2/financial_profile.py`

**Current FinancialProfile Dataclass Fields:**

From Life Insurance:
- `has_life_insurance: str`
- `life_insurance_type: Optional[str]`
- `life_insurance_face_value: float`
- `life_insurance_cash_value: float`
- `life_insurance_premium_monthly: float`
- `has_annuities: str`
- `annuity_current_value: float`
- `annuity_monthly_income: float`
- `total_accessible_life_value: float`

From Health Insurance:

- `aware_of_asset_limits: str`
- `current_asset_position: str`
- `aware_of_estate_recovery: bool`
- `interested_in_elder_law: bool`

**Note:** Some new fields from rebuilt assessments may need to be added to FinancialProfile dataclass for full integration.

### MCIP Contract Integration

**Publishing:** `/products/cost_planner_v2/financial_profile.py:publish_to_mcip()`

**Contract:** `core/mcip.py:FinancialProfile` dataclass

**Fields Published:**
- `estimated_monthly_cost: float`
- `coverage_percentage: float`
- `gap_amount: float`
- `runway_months: int`
- `confidence: float` (from completeness_percentage)
- `generated_at: str` (ISO timestamp)
- `status: str` ("complete" or "in_progress")

**Timeline Engine:**
- Uses `MCIP.get_financial_profile()` to access aggregated data
- Calculates runway based on gap, assets, and income
- Factors in VA benefits, LTC insurance, and other coverage

---

## Visual Consistency Checklist

All 4 rebuilt assessments match Income/Assets on:

- ✅ White card background
- ✅ H2 section headers with icons
- ✅ Inline `help_text` under section headers
- ✅ Field-level `help` text below each input
- ✅ Info boxes use `type: "info"` consistently
- ✅ Intro section with single-line help_text
- ✅ Results section for completion tracking
- ✅ Calculated or text summary at bottom
- ✅ Single-column layout (`layout: "single_column"`)
- ✅ Accessible field labels (no label_visibility: "collapsed")
- ✅ NO Basic/Advanced toggle
- ✅ Conditional field visibility via `visible_if`

---

## Key Differences from Income/Assets

### What's the Same:
- JSON-driven structure
- Shared renderer (`assessment_engine.py`)
- Data persistence to `tiles.cost_planner_v2.assessments.{key}`
- MCIP integration via `financial_profile.py`
- Accessible labels and help text
- Info boxes and section organization

### What's Different:
- **NO `level` property** on fields (no Basic/Advanced mode)
- **Always full view** (no toggle rendering)
- **Optional** (not required for expert review)
- **Mixed summary types** (calculated for financial totals, text for Medicaid planning)
- **Flag-based visibility** (VA Benefits only shows if `is_veteran = true`)
- **Simpler field sets** (no advanced breakdown like Income/Assets)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for Production):
1. **Update `_SINGLE_PAGE_ASSESSMENTS`** in `assessments.py` to include all 4 rebuilt assessments for consistent single-page rendering
2. **Update `FinancialProfile` dataclass** in `financial_profile.py` to include all new fields from rebuilt assessments
3. **Test rendering** of all 4 assessments in running app
4. **Verify data flow** to financial_profile.py and MCIP
5. **Manual QA** - Complete all 6 assessments end-to-end

### Enhancement (Optional):
1. **VA Benefits Auto-Calculation** - Add Python logic to auto-populate disability payment based on rating + dependents
2. **A&A Eligibility Checker** - Build calculator that uses MAPR limits, income from Income assessment, and ADL needs from GCP
3. **Medicaid Asset Limit Lookup** - Add state-specific asset limits database for real-time eligibility estimation
4. **LTC Insurance Parser** - Extract daily benefit, benefit period from free-text field into structured data
5. **Navi Integration** - Add assessment-specific Navi messages using dynamic content system

### Documentation:
1. Add user guide for completing each assessment
2. Document field mappings to FinancialProfile dataclass
3. Create flowchart showing data flow: Assessment → FinancialProfile → MCIP → Timeline
4. Add API documentation for output contracts

## Known Limitations / Future Work

1. **VA Benefits Auto-Calculation Not Implemented:**
   - Current: User manually enters monthly payment
   - Desired: Auto-populate based on rating + dependents from 2025 rate table
   - Requires: Python calculation logic in renderer or pre-processing

2. **A&A Eligibility Not Automated:**
   - Current: User self-assesses eligibility
   - Desired: Auto-check based on income (from Income assessment) + ADL needs (from GCP) vs MAPR limits
   - Requires: Cross-assessment data access and calculation engine

3. **FinancialProfile Dataclass May Need Updates:**
   - Some new fields from rebuilt assessments may not map to existing dataclass properties
   - Review and add missing fields to ensure full data capture

4. **Single-Page Rendering Not Configured:**
   - Rebuilt assessments currently use multi-step flow via `run_assessment()`
   - To match Income/Assets UX, add to `_SINGLE_PAGE_ASSESSMENTS` dict

5. **Navi Messages Static:**
   - Help text is in JSON, but dynamic Navi panel not configured
   - Could integrate with Navi content system for contextual guidance
