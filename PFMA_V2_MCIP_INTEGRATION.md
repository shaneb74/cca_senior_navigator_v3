# Award duck only if moving to next step for first time
if pfma.get("ducks_earned", 0) == 0:  # On step 1 completion
    pfma["ducks_earned"] = 1
    st.balloons()

if pfma.get("ducks_earned", 0) == 1:  # On step 2 completion
    pfma["ducks_earned"] = 2
    st.balloons()

# Etc...
```

### Sidebar Display

```
ü¶Ü Your Progress
Ducks Earned: 3/4

ü¶Üü¶Üü¶Ü‚ö™

[====== 75%]
```
