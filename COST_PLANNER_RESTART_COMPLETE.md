# Cost Planner Restart & Demo User Pre-Population - COMPLETE

## Summary
Fixed Cost Planner restart functionality and implemented demo user assessment pre-population.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Continue to Full Assessment Button Not Working (FIXED ✅)
**Problem:** After restart, clicking "Continue to Full Assessment" stayed on intro page instead of navigating to auth step.

**Root Cause:** The Restart button navigates with `?step=intro` query parameter. This query param persisted in the URL. When Continue button set session step to "auth", the query param override logic changed it back to "intro".

**Solution:** Clear the `step` query parameter when navigating from intro to auth.

**Files Changed:**
- `products/cost_planner_v2/intro.py`: Added `del st.query_params["step"]` before setting step to "auth"

**Commit:** `935a765` - "fix: Clear step query param when navigating to auth"

### 2. Assessment Forms Not Pre-Populating for Demo Users (FIXED ✅)
**Problem:** When loading demo users (e.g., Mary), the Income and Assets assessment forms showed blank fields instead of pre-filled data from the demo file.

**Root Cause:** Pre-population logic was added to `render_assessment_page()`, but Income and Assets assessments use `_render_single_page_assessment()` instead. The data existed in `cost_v2_modules` but wasn't being loaded into the assessment state.

**Solution:** Added same pre-population logic to `_render_single_page_assessment()` to check `cost_v2_modules` and load data before rendering.

**Files Changed:**
- `products/cost_planner_v2/assessments.py`: Added pre-population check in `_render_single_page_assessment()`

**Commits:**
- `e291179` - "feat: Pre-populate assessments from cost_v2_modules"
- `915889b` - "fix: Add pre-population logic to _render_single_page_assessment"

## How It Works

### Query Parameter Navigation Fix
```python
# Before navigating to auth, clear any step query param
if "step" in st.query_params:
    del st.query_params["step"]

st.session_state.cost_v2_step = "auth"
st.rerun()
```

### Assessment Pre-Population
```python
# Check if demo/saved data exists in cost_v2_modules
modules = st.session_state.get("cost_v2_modules", {})
if assessment_key in modules:
    module_data = modules[assessment_key].get("data", {})
    if module_data and state_key not in st.session_state:
        # Load saved data into assessment state
        st.session_state[state_key] = module_data.copy()
```

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Fresh User (Continue Button)
1. Start app fresh (no query params)
2. Navigate to Cost Planner
3. Calculate estimate
4. Click "Continue to Full Assessment"
5. ✅ Should navigate to auth step (not stay on intro)

### Test Scenario 2: Demo User Restart (Continue Button)
1. Load demo user (e.g., Mary)
2. Click "Restart" on Cost Planner tile
3. Calculate estimate
4. Click "Continue to Full Assessment"
5. ✅ Should navigate to auth step (query param cleared)

### Test Scenario 3: Demo User Pre-Population
1. Load demo user with existing assessment data
2. Click Restart → Calculate → Continue → Sign In
3. Navigate to Income or Assets assessment
4. ✅ Forms should show pre-filled data from demo file

## Demo User Data Loaded

**Mary (demo_mary_memory_care):**
- Income: 17 fields including SS ($2,800), Pension ($3,200), Retirement ($2,000) = $8,000/month total
- Assets: 19+ fields including Checking ($30K), Savings ($100K), Brokerage ($800K), Retirement ($500K), Home ($450K) = $1.95M total

## Logs (Debug Mode)

When assessment loads, you'll see:
```
[ASSESSMENT] Initializing income
[ASSESSMENT]   state_key: cost_planner_v2_income
[ASSESSMENT]   cost_v2_modules exists: True
[ASSESSMENT]   cost_v2_modules keys: ['income', 'assets']
[ASSESSMENT]   ✅ Pre-populating income from cost_v2_modules
[ASSESSMENT] income final state has 17 fields
```

## Cleanup Status

✅ Removed debug logging from:
- `products/cost_planner_v2/intro.py`
- `products/cost_planner_v2/auth.py`

⚠️ Debug logging remains in (can be removed later):
- `products/cost_planner_v2/product.py` (routing logic)
- `products/cost_planner_v2/assessments.py` (pre-population logic)

## Files Modified

1. `products/cost_planner_v2/intro.py` - Query param clearing
2. `products/cost_planner_v2/auth.py` - Removed debug logs
3. `products/cost_planner_v2/assessments.py` - Pre-population logic

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All restart and pre-population issues resolved. Cost Planner now works correctly with:
- Fresh users
- Demo users
- Restart functionality
- Assessment data persistence
