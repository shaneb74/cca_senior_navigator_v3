"""Learn About My Recommendation - Educational Bridge Product

Phase 4B: Educational and empathetic step between GCP and Cost Planner.
Helps users understand their recommendation before planning costs or scheduling advisors.

Phase Post-CSS: Redesigned to match Discovery Journey layout
- Story-driven single-column design
- Embedded YouTube video for care recommendation education
- Enhanced typography and spacing
- Mobile responsive design

Flow:
1. Display personalized care recommendation from GCP
2. NAVI provides educational context
3. Video explains the care level
4. User reads and reflects
5. Continue to Cost Planner when ready

Architecture:
- Reads care recommendation from MCIP
- Provides tier-specific educational content and videos
- Tracks completion in MCIP for tile state
- Routes to Cost Planner on continue
