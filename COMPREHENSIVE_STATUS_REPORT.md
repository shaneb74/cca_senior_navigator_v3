### 2. Aggregate Display Feature ✅

**Commit:** `fd0eafd docs: Add Phase 1 testing guide`  
**Implementation:** Earlier in feature development

**What It Does:**
- Display-only aggregate totals (e.g., "Total Liquid Assets")
- Real-time calculation from sub-fields
- Styled blue labels (not editable to avoid confusion)
- Automatic $X,XXX.XX formatting

**Field Type:** `display_currency_aggregate`  
**File:** `core/assessment_engine.py` (lines 518-560)

**Features:**
- Reads from `st.session_state` for instant updates
- Handles int, float, and string inputs safely
- Styled: blue background (#f0f9ff), bold text, right-aligned
- Used in assets.json for section totals

---

### 3. Cost Planner Persistence Fix ✅

**Commit:** `2e39e83 fix: Cost Planner v2 persistence and conditional field visibility`  
**Date:** Prior to October 20, 2025

**Root Cause:**
- USER_PERSIST_KEYS had wrong key names
- Used `cost_v2_income` instead of `cost_planner_v2_income`
- Assessment data wasn't being saved to disk
- On app restart, forms appeared empty

**The Fix:**
Updated `core/session_store.py` USER_PERSIST_KEYS with correct names:

**Changed from:**
```python
"cost_v2_income",
"cost_v2_assets",
"cost_v2_va_benefits",
# etc...
```

**Changed to:**
```python
"cost_planner_v2_income",  # Income assessment state
"cost_planner_v2_assets",  # Assets assessment state  
"cost_planner_v2_va_benefits",  # VA benefits assessment state
"cost_planner_v2_health_insurance",  # Health insurance state
"cost_planner_v2_life_insurance",  # Life insurance state
"cost_planner_v2_medicaid_navigation",  # Medicaid navigation state
```

**Result:**
- ✅ All assessment responses now persist across app restarts
- ✅ Financial timeline uses complete saved data
- ✅ Expert review has access to all user inputs

**File:** `core/session_store.py` (lines 565-580)

---

### 4. Asset Calculation Logic ✅

**Commits:** Multiple (integrated over time)

**Helper Functions:**
- ✅ `calculate_total_asset_value()` - Sums all asset fields
- ✅ `calculate_total_asset_debt()` - Sums all debt fields
- ✅ Net Assets = Gross Assets - Total Debt

**Summary Calculation:**
- ✅ `calculated_by_engine` formula detects assessment type
- ✅ Applies correct calculation for assets vs income
- ✅ Used in summary boxes and expert review

**Files:**
- `products/cost_planner_v2/utils/financial_helpers.py`
- `products/cost_planner_v2/assessments.py` (lines 855-875)
- `products/cost_planner_v2/expert_review.py`

---

### 5. VA Benefits Auto-Population ✅

**Commits:** 
- `ee5a194` - Trigger rerun after auto-population
- `23d05bc` - Fix currency field type for decimals

**What It Does:**
- Auto-populates VA disability monthly amount based on:
  - Disability rating percentage (10%-100%)
  - Dependent status (none, spouse, children)
- Uses official 2025 VA rate tables
- Shows in both field AND summary box
- User can manually override if needed

**Files:**
- `products/cost_planner_v2/assessments.py`
- `products/cost_planner_v2/va_rates.py`

## 🔍 How to Verify Everything Works

### Step 1: Check Persistence
```bash
# Start app
streamlit run app.py

# Complete Income assessment with sample data
# Note your UID from URL: ?uid=anon_xxxxxxxxxx

# Stop app (Ctrl+C)

# Check data file
cat data/users/anon_xxxxxxxxxx.json | jq '.cost_planner_v2_income'
# Should show your saved data ✅

# Restart app with same UID
streamlit run app.py
# Navigate to: http://localhost:8501/?uid=anon_xxxxxxxxxx

# Go to Cost Planner → Income
# Your data should be pre-populated ✅
```

### Step 2: Check Asset Fields
```bash
# In app: Cost Planner → Assets

# Should see 20 fields:
# - Household Context (2)
# - Liquid Assets (3)  
# - Investments (3)
# - Retirement (3)
# - Real Estate (4)
# - Debts (5)
```

### Step 3: Check Aggregate Display
```bash
# In Assets assessment:
# Enter values in sub-fields (e.g., checking, savings)
# Look for blue aggregate labels showing totals
# Should update in real-time as you type ✅
```

### Step 4: Check VA Auto-Population
```bash
# In VA Benefits assessment:
# Answer "Yes" to "Do you receive VA Disability?"
# Select rating: "60%"
# Select dependents: "Veteran with spouse and one child"

# Monthly VA Disability Payment field should show: $1,622.44 ✅
# Summary should also show: $1,622/month ✅
```
