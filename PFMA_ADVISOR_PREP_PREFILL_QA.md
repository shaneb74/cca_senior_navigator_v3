# PFMA Advisor Prep Prefill - QA Testing Checklist

**Implementation Complete:** October 17, 2025
**Testing Started:** October 17, 2025

## Implementation Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed Components

1. **Prefill Logic Module** (`products/advisor_prep/prefill.py`)
   - `get_financial_prefill()` - Returns prefilled financial data
   - `get_care_needs_prefill()` - Returns derived care need toggles
   - `update_care_need_flag()` - Updates canonical flags on user changes

2. **Financial Module Integration** (`products/advisor_prep/modules/financial.py`)
   - Imports and calls `get_financial_prefill()`
   - Shows context message when prefill data exists
   - Field rendering prioritizes: saved ‚Üí prefill ‚Üí empty
   - Adds prefill provenance hints in help text

3. **Medical Module Integration** (`products/advisor_prep/modules/medical.py`)
   - Imports and calls `get_care_needs_prefill()`
   - Chronic conditions multiselect uses prefilled data
   - Care flags checkboxes use derived states with provenance hints
   - All 8 care needs render with reasons when prefilled

4. **JSON Configs Updated**
   - `financial.json`: Added `prefill_hint: true`, changed to `primary_concern` (singular)
   - `medical.json`: All 8 care flags configured correctly

### ‚úÖ Compilation Status
```
‚úÖ prefill.py compiles successfully
‚úÖ financial.py compiles successfully  
‚úÖ medical.py compiles successfully

## QA Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: GCP-Only Path (Care Needs Derivation)
**Setup:**
- Complete Guided Care Plan with cognition + mobility + diabetes flags
- Do NOT complete Cost Planner
- Navigate to Advisor Prep ‚Üí Medical & Care Needs

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Chronic conditions multiselect shows: Dementia, Mobility Impairment, Diabetes
- ‚úÖ Care needs toggles ON with provenance hints:
  - Memory Support: "üí° Prefilled from Cognition concerns in your care plan"
  - Mobility Assistance: "üí° Prefilled from Mobility limitations in your care plan"
  - Diabetic Care: "üí° Prefilled from Diabetes in your conditions"
- ‚úÖ Other toggles OFF (Medication Management, Behavioral, Oxygen, Wound, Hospice)
- ‚úÖ Context message: "We've brought over some information from your Guided Care Plan..."

**Test Results:**
- [ ] Chronic conditions prefilled correctly
- [ ] Care needs toggles derived correctly
- [ ] Provenance hints show correct sources
- [ ] Context message displays
- [ ] User can edit/override all values

---

### Scenario 2: CP-Only Path (Financial Prefill)
**Setup:**
- Complete Cost Planner Income & Assets assessment
  - Monthly Income: $3,000
  - Total Assets: $50,000
  - Insurance: Medicare Part A, Part B
- Do NOT complete Guided Care Plan
- Navigate to Advisor Prep ‚Üí Financial Overview

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Monthly Income shows: $3,000 with hint "Prefilled from Cost Planner"
- ‚úÖ Total Assets shows: $50,000 with hint "Prefilled from Cost Planner"
- ‚úÖ Insurance Coverage shows: Medicare Part A, Part B with hint "Prefilled from Cost Planner"
- ‚úÖ Primary Concern derives from gap analysis
- ‚úÖ Context message: "We've brought over what we already know from Cost Planner..."

**Test Results:**
- [ ] Monthly Income prefilled correctly
- [ ] Total Assets prefilled correctly
- [ ] Insurance Coverage prefilled correctly
- [ ] Primary Concern derived correctly
- [ ] Provenance hints show in help text
- [ ] User can edit/override all values

---

### Scenario 3: Combined Path (Both GCP + CP)
**Setup:**
- Complete Guided Care Plan with medication management flag
- Complete Cost Planner financial assessments
- Navigate to Advisor Prep ‚Üí Both sections

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Financial Overview prefills from Cost Planner
- ‚úÖ Medical & Care Needs shows medication management toggle ON
- ‚úÖ Provenance hints reference both sources appropriately
- ‚úÖ All fields editable

**Test Results:**
- [ ] Financial data prefills from CP
- [ ] Care needs derive from GCP flags
- [ ] Both context messages display
- [ ] No conflicts or duplication

---

### Scenario 4: User Override Test
**Setup:**
- Start with Scenario 1 (GCP with care needs prefilled)
- Navigate to Medical & Care Needs
- Turn OFF "Memory Support" toggle (was ON from prefill)
- Save section

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Memory Support toggle turns OFF
- ‚úÖ Change persists after save
- ‚úÖ Canonical flag `memory_support` deactivated in Flag Manager
- ‚úÖ Re-opening section shows Memory Support OFF (not re-prefilled)
- ‚úÖ User override takes precedence over prefill

**Test Results:**
- [ ] Toggle changes accepted
- [ ] Save persists user override
- [ ] Flag Manager updated correctly
- [ ] Re-opening respects user override
- [ ] No re-prefill after user edit

---

### Scenario 5: No Surprises (Conservative Derivation)
**Setup:**
- New user, no GCP or CP data
- Navigate to Advisor Prep ‚Üí Medical & Care Needs

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ NO toggles prefilled (all OFF)
- ‚úÖ NO context message displays
- ‚úÖ Clean slate for user to fill out
- ‚úÖ Hospice/Palliative toggle OFF (not auto-prefilled unless explicit signal)
- ‚úÖ Wound Care toggle OFF (not auto-prefilled unless explicit signal)

**Test Results:**
- [ ] All toggles start OFF
- [ ] No prefill message shown
- [ ] No unwanted auto-population
- [ ] Conservative derivation working

---

### Scenario 6: Accessibility Check
**Setup:**
- Complete Scenarios 1 or 2
- Use screen reader (VoiceOver on Mac, NVDA on Windows) or keyboard navigation

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ All labels visible and readable
- ‚úÖ Provenance hints readable via screen reader
- ‚úÖ Context message announced
- ‚úÖ Keyboard navigation works (Tab, Space, Enter)
- ‚úÖ No hidden labels or missing descriptions

**Test Results:**
- [ ] Labels visible in UI
- [ ] Screen reader reads labels correctly
- [ ] Help text accessible
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] ARIA attributes correct
