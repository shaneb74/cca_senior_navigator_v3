# Cost Planner Assessment Save Navigation Fix

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Issue:** Save button doesn't navigate back to Financial Assessment Hub  
**Branch:** `bugfix/gcp-issues`  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## Problem Summary

When users clicked "Save Income Information" (or any assessment's save button) in Cost Planner v2, they remained on the assessment page. Users expected to be returned to the Financial Assessment Hub after saving.

### User Impact

- Confusing UX - users didn't know where to go after saving
- Required manual navigation back to hub
- Unclear if save was successful
- Inconsistent with user expectations

---

## Expected Behavior

After clicking any assessment's save button (e.g., "Save Income Information", "Save Asset Information", etc.):
1. ✅ Assessment data is saved
2. ✅ Success message displays
3. ✅ User is navigated back to Financial Assessment Hub
4. ✅ Assessment shows as "completed" on hub

---

## The Fix

### Code Change

**File:** `products/cost_planner_v2/assessments.py`  
**Function:** `_render_single_page_assessment()` - Save button handler (line ~636)

```python
# BEFORE:
if st.button(save_label, ...):
    # ... validation and save logic ...
    if previously_done:
        log_event("assessment.updated", event_payload)
    else:
        log_event("assessment.completed", event_payload)
    safe_rerun()  # ❌ Just refreshes current page

# AFTER:
if st.button(save_label, ...):
    # ... validation and save logic ...
    if previously_done:
        log_event("assessment.updated", event_payload)
    else:
        log_event("assessment.completed", event_payload)
    
    # Navigate back to Financial Assessment Hub
    st.session_state.cost_v2_step = "assessments"  # ✅ Go to hub
    st.session_state.pop(f"{product_key}_current_assessment", None)  # ✅ Clear current
    safe_rerun()  # ✅ Refresh to hub
```

### Key Changes

1. **Set `cost_v2_step = "assessments"`** - Navigates to hub
2. **Clear `current_assessment`** - Ensures clean hub display
3. **Then call `safe_rerun()`** - Triggers navigation

---

## How It Works

### Navigation Flow

```
1. User on Income Assessment page
2. User fills out fields
3. User clicks "Save Income Information"
4. Validation passes ✅
5. Data saved to session state ✅
6. Event logged ✅
7. cost_v2_step = "assessments" (set hub as target)
8. current_assessment cleared (no assessment selected)
9. safe_rerun() triggers page refresh
10. product.py sees cost_v2_step == "assessments"
11. Calls render_assessment_hub()
12. User sees Financial Assessment Hub ✅
13. Income assessment shows "completed" status ✅
```

### Navigation State Management

**Cost Planner uses `cost_v2_step` for navigation:**
- `"intro"` → Introduction/Quick Estimate
- `"triage"` → Triage Questions
- `"assessments"` → **Financial Assessment Hub** ← Target
- `"expert_review"` → Expert Review & Timeline
- `"exit"` → Summary & Next Steps

**When `cost_v2_step = "assessments"`:**
- Product.py routes to `render_assessment_hub()`
- Hub displays assessment cards with completion status
- User can select another assessment or proceed to Expert Review

## Testing Verification

### Test Cases

#### Test 1: Save Income Assessment ✅
```
1. Navigate to Income assessment
2. Fill out fields (employment income, other income, etc.)
3. Click "Save Income Information"
   Expected: Return to hub, Income shows "completed"
   Actual: Return to hub, Income shows "completed" ✅
```

#### Test 2: Save Assets Assessment ✅
```
1. Navigate to Assets assessment
2. Fill out fields (savings, property, etc.)
3. Click "Save Asset Information"
   Expected: Return to hub, Assets shows "completed"
   Actual: Return to hub, Assets shows "completed" ✅
```

#### Test 3: Save with Validation Errors ✅
```
1. Navigate to VA Benefits assessment
2. Leave required fields empty
3. Click "Save VA Benefits Information"
   Expected: Stay on page, show error message
   Actual: Stay on page, show error message ✅
   (No navigation occurs when validation fails)
```

#### Test 4: Update Existing Assessment ✅
```
1. Navigate to Income assessment (already completed)
2. Change "Employment Income" value
3. Click "Save Income Information"
   Expected: Return to hub, Income still shows "completed"
   Actual: Return to hub, Income still shows "completed" ✅
   (Updates don't change completion status)
```

#### Test 5: All Assessments ✅
```
Test each assessment's save button:
- ✅ Income → "Save Income Information"
- ✅ Assets → "Save Asset Information"
- ✅ VA Benefits → "Save VA Benefits Information"
- ✅ Health Insurance → "Save Health Insurance Information"
- ✅ Life Insurance → "Save Life Insurance & Annuity Information"
- ✅ Medicaid Navigation → "Save Medicaid Planning Information"

All navigate back to hub after successful save ✅
```

## Back Button Behavior

**Note:** The "Back to Assessments" button already had this behavior:

```python
# Line ~630 (col1 - Back button)
if st.button("← Back to Assessments", ...):
    st.session_state.cost_v2_step = "assessments"
    safe_rerun()
```

**Now the Save button matches the Back button's navigation behavior!**

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Validation Failure
```
Scenario: Required fields missing
Behavior: 
- Error message displays
- Navigation does NOT occur
- User stays on assessment page
- User can fix errors and retry
✅ Correct - only navigate on successful save
```

### 2. First Time Save vs Update
```
Scenario: User saves assessment for first time
Behavior:
- Logs "assessment.completed" event
- Navigates to hub
- Shows "completed" badge
✅ Works

Scenario: User updates already-completed assessment
Behavior:
- Logs "assessment.updated" event
- Navigates to hub
- Still shows "completed" badge
✅ Works
```

### 3. Expert Review Button
```
Scenario: User clicks "Expert Review" instead of "Save"
Behavior:
- Navigates to expert_review step
- Does NOT clear current assessment
✅ No change - expert review navigation still works
```

### 4. Session State Cleanup
```
Scenario: User navigates back to hub
Behavior:
- current_assessment key removed
- Hub displays all assessments
- No assessment pre-selected
- Clean slate for next selection
✅ Correct - prevents stale state
```

### Navigation Pattern Consistency

**Other places that navigate to assessments hub:**

1. **Expert Review "Back" button** (`expert_review.py` line 123):
```python
st.session_state.cost_v2_step = "assessments"
safe_rerun()
```

2. **Triage "Continue" button** (`triage.py` line 117):
```python
st.session_state.cost_v2_step = "assessments"
safe_rerun()
```

3. **Expert Review "Continue" after reviewing** (`expert_review.py` line 401):
```python
st.session_state.cost_v2_step = "assessments"
safe_rerun()
```

**Our fix follows the same pattern!** ✅
