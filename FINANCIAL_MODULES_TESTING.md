## üö® Troubleshooting

### If modules don't appear:
1. Check `config/cost_planner_v2_modules.json` loaded correctly
2. Verify module registry in `products/cost_planner_v2/modules/__init__.py`
3. Check Cost Planner Hub rendering logic for module loading

### If conditional fields don't work:
1. Check `visible_if` logic in JSON config
2. Verify field keys match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Test with browser console open for JS errors

### If calculations are wrong:
1. Verify formula in JSON config
2. Check Python calculation logic in module .py files
3. Test with simple values first

### If data doesn't persist:
1. Check session state keys match module keys
2. Verify `st.session_state.cost_v2_modules[module_key]` structure
3. Look for session state clearing/reset logic
