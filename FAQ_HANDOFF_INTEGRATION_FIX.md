# FAQ Handoff Integration Fix

## Issue Summary
The FAQ/AI Advisor page was using an outdated session state structure to read GCP flags, preventing context-aware question filtering from working correctly.

## Problem Details

**File:** `pages/faq.py`  
**Lines:** 205-215  
**Issue:** Reading from `st.session_state.get("gcp", {})` which doesn't exist after handoff system implementation

### Old Code (BROKEN)
```python
# Get user context from session state
gcp_state = st.session_state.get("gcp", {})  # ❌ DOESN'T EXIST
cost_planner_state = st.session_state.get("cost_planner_base", {})
cost_data = st.session_state.get("cost_data", {})

# Get GCP flags
gcp_flags = gcp_state.get("flags", {})
care_recommendation = gcp_state.get("recommendation", {})
care_type = care_recommendation.get("care_type", "")  # ❌ recommendation is now a string
```

### Root Cause
1. **Old State Structure:** Before the handoff system, GCP stored data directly in `st.session_state["gcp"]`
2. **New State Structure:** After handoff system, all product outcomes stored in `st.session_state["handoff"]["gcp"]`
3. **Data Type Change:** `recommendation` changed from dict with `care_type` key to simple string value ("In-Home Care", "Assisted Living", etc.)

## Solution Implemented

### New Code (FIXED)
```python
# Get user context from session state
handoff = st.session_state.get("handoff", {})  # ✅ Read from handoff
gcp_state = handoff.get("gcp", {})  # ✅ Get GCP product data
cost_planner_state = st.session_state.get("cost_planner_base", {})
cost_data = st.session_state.get("cost_data", {})

# Get GCP flags from handoff
gcp_flags = gcp_state.get("flags", {})  # ✅ Flags stored here
care_recommendation = gcp_state.get("recommendation", "")  # ✅ Now a string
# care_recommendation is now a string (e.g., "In-Home Care", "Assisted Living")
care_type = care_recommendation.lower().replace(" ", "_") if care_recommendation else ""  # ✅ Convert to slug
```

### Changes Made
1. **Line 205:** Added `handoff = st.session_state.get("handoff", {})`
2. **Line 206:** Changed to `gcp_state = handoff.get("gcp", {})`
3. **Line 210:** Updated comment to clarify flags from handoff
4. **Line 211:** Changed to `care_recommendation = gcp_state.get("recommendation", "")`
5. **Line 213:** Added comment explaining recommendation is now a string
6. **Line 214:** Updated to convert string to slug format (`"In-Home Care"` → `"in-home_care"`)

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ GCP flags not read correctly (empty dict)
- ❌ Context-aware question filtering didn't work
- ❌ Questions like "How do I choose a memory care facility?" wouldn't show for users with cognitive_risk flag
- ❌ Veteran-specific questions wouldn't show for users with veteran_aanda_risk flag

### After Fix
- ✅ GCP flags read correctly from handoff
- ✅ Context-aware question filtering works
- ✅ Questions filtered based on user's actual GCP assessment flags
- ✅ Example: User with `cognitive_risk` flag sees memory care questions
- ✅ Example: User with `veteran_aanda_risk` flag sees VA benefits questions
- ✅ Example: User with `fall_risk` flag sees fall prevention questions

## Verification

### Syntax Check
```bash
python3 -m py_compile pages/faq.py
# ✅ Compiles successfully
```

### Testing Plan
1. **Complete GCP Assessment** with flags:
   - Set cognitive_risk flag (answer memory issues)
   - Set veteran_aanda_risk flag (answer BADL needs)
   - Set fall_risk flag (answer multiple falls)
   
2. **Navigate to FAQ/AI Advisor**
   - Click FAQ tile in Concierge Hub
   - Verify suggested questions include cognitive/veteran/fall-related questions
   
3. **Verify Flag Filtering**
   - Check that questions with `requires_flags: ["cognitive_risk"]` appear
   - Check that questions with `requires_flags: ["veteran_aanda_risk"]` appear
   - Check that questions without matching flags don't appear

### Integration Points
1. **GCP Module Engine** (`core/modules/engine.py`)
   - Stores flags in `handoff["gcp"]["flags"]`
   - Stores recommendation in `handoff["gcp"]["recommendation"]`

2. **FAQ Question Database** (`config/faq_database.json`)
   - 14 questions with `requires_flags` filtering
   - Examples:
     - Question 6: `requires_flags: ["cognitive_risk"]` - Memory care facility selection
     - Question 10: `requires_flags: ["veteran_aanda_risk"]` - VA benefits eligibility
     - Question 13: `requires_flags: ["fall_risk"]` - Fall prevention in home care

3. **Additional Services** (`core/additional_services.py`)
   - Also reads from `handoff[product_key]["flags"]`
   - Aggregates flags from all products
   - Uses for service visibility (Omcare, Memory Care, VA Benefits, etc.)

### Handoff Structure
```python
st.session_state["handoff"] = {
    "gcp": {
        "recommendation": "In-Home Care",  # String value
        "flags": {
            "cognitive_risk": True,
            "veteran_aanda_risk": True,
            "fall_risk": True,
            "medication_risk": True,
            # ... 25+ flags total
        },
        "tags": [],
        "domain_scores": {}
    },
    # Other products (cost_planner, pfma) follow same structure
}
```

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - FAQ now correctly reads GCP flags from handoff structure  
✅ **VERIFIED** - Code compiles successfully  
⏳ **PENDING TESTING** - Manual testing needed to verify context-aware question filtering

## Next Steps

1. **Test Complete Flag Flow** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Complete GCP with various answer combinations
   - Verify flags set in `handoff["gcp"]["flags"]`
   - Navigate to FAQ and verify suggested questions filtered correctly

2. **Test Edge Cases**
   - User with no GCP completion (empty flags) → Should show generic questions
   - User with multiple flags → Should show all matching questions
   - User with no matching flags → Should show fallback questions

3. **Full Integration Test**
   - Complete journey: GCP → Cost Planner → FAQ
   - Verify flags persist across navigation
   - Verify FAQ questions update based on GCP results
